      "abstract": "In 2005 the Love-Rusty 3000 was a state of the art crypto accelerator. Developed by the infamous Robert Love & Rusty Russell, it was the talk of Linux.conf.au 2005. Many intrepid kernel hackers spent much of the conference developing a Linux driver for the advanced feature set[1].\r\n\r\nSadly in 2018 the hardware is no longer available, the innovative & advanced feature set can no longer inspire new Engineers. This doesn't have to be the end thanks to the development of low cost and accessible FPGA hardware. You **can** help resurrect this jewel of a device to inspire the next generation! What was old is new again!\r\n\r\nThe [Migen tooling developed by M-Labs](https://m-labs.hk/gateware.html) when extended by [EnjoyDigital's litex ecosystem](http://www.enjoy-digital.fr/) enables creation of \"System on Chip\" (SoCs) that can run Linux. Using a Python based HDL[2] combined with open CPUs[3] cores, the complete source code available under open source licenses.\r\n\r\nThis technology has been used in everything from custom mobile phone base stations, [quantum mechanics physics experiments](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/index.html) and is even the basis for the [TimVideos HDMI2USB project](https://hdmi2usb.tv) which is currently being used to record Linux.conf.au!\r\n\r\nDuring the day we will take you through the following;\r\n\r\n * Creating your own SoC using Python based Migen and litex.\r\n * Running your SoC on an FPGA and booting into Linux.\r\n * Creating a peripheral providing the Love-Rusty 3000 feature set and adding to your SoC.\r\n * Controlling your new peripheral from Linux.\r\n\r\nThis will all be done without ever directly touching a single line of Verilog or VHDL. No experience in either of these languages is required!\r\n\r\nWhile this tutorials aims to be as accessible as possible, only so much can be covered in a day. For this reason attendees are required to;\r\n\r\n * Have strong programming experience. Python and C will be in heavy use.\r\n * Have compiled and customized their own Linux kernel. \r\n   *(Experience with Linux Kernel development is a definite plus!)*\r\n * Must do the prework at http://XXXXX before the tutorial. \r\n   *(Anyone who hasn't done the pre-work will be asked to leave.)*\r\n * Understanding of how a CPU operates.\r\n   *(Understanding what CSR registers and \"memory mapped IO\" are a plus.)*\r\n\r\nThis tutorial requires hardware to complete, you must have the following;\r\n\r\n * An FPGA development board on the list at http://XXXX -- A number of loaner boards are available, contact mithro@mithis.com\r\n * You **must** have a fast, modern, laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or a version later than 16.04\r\n    Linux in a VM on Mac OS X can be problematic.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://linux.org.au/conf/2005/abstractb2b1.html?id=296\r\n[2]: Hardware description language\r\n[3]: Like any of Pico RISC V, OpenRISC 1K, LatticeMicro32 or J2 open processor.",

Code with good tests is so much easier to work with and change due to the comfort the tests provide that you haven't broken anything you didn't expect to break.\r\n\r\nC can be a tricky language to work in. It compiles to static code. It's incredibly low-level compared to many of the languages people use these days. It also comes with a delightfully bewildering and wide array of ways to very effectively shoot yourself in the foot. On top of that the POSIX API implementations C code often relies on don't lend themselves to easy testing, especially of unhappy paths. Which means that while we should absolutely be testing our C code it should be really hard to unit test, right?\r\n\r\nJoin me for a quick overview of the ways in which C can be unit tested, including ways to push around the POSIX APIs, and how you too can increase your C code's level of comfort.",

What can we learn from art created using neural networks and what can we create? From the frivolous to the beautiful what does art created by computers look like and where can it take us?\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore magenta in tensorflow and neural style in caffe, google deep dream, next Rembrandt, and convolutional neural networks. I will look into some of the beautiful applications of machine learning in art and some of the ridiculous ones as well. From paint samples to autonomous works I will explore the joys and horrors of machine learning for artistic purposes.

Meanwhile, the \"Free Software\" we hack on at home has mostly stayed in the 1990's with stdin/stdout, writing to local files, and home directories.  This divergence has flow-on effects everywhere, such as shifting license choices for major building blocks, increased use of centralised free-as-in-beer services, and less support for federation and standardised network protocols.\r\n\r\nDespite this, all the same pressures driving corporate changes _also_ apply at home, just at smaller scale.\r\nThis talk will demonstrate how easy it is to build and maintain an elastic, fault-tolerant *home* Kubernetes cluster out of spare hardware.  We walk through what the machine lifecycle looks like and how to solve typical home tasks like interactive shell accounts, printing or other network services, and periodic background jobs.\r\n\r\nBy the end you will be convinced of not just the practical but also the strategic reasons to modernise your home computing environment.

These improvements are undeniable and noticeable but it turns out that selling them to people was a lot tougher than it first seems. We shall go through the history of Meson and talk about the all the hidden work behind the scenes that needed to be done before projects were willing to transition off their tried and true build systems to the new shiny.\r\n\r\nThe presentation concludes by looking at new features that are in the pipeline and other new things we should expect from Meson in the future.",

How did we come up with all these peculiar behaviors?\r\n\r\nLet a kernel programmer from the 1970's take you through some of the history, mindset and all too often politics that have created the security paradigms, facilities and features we know in Linux today. We'll cover a few things from before the epoch (1 January, 1970) and the early days of UNIX. There will be a bit about the American \"Orange Book\", and how \"C2 in '92\" drove a frenzy of security feature development. We'll discuss how that lead to the POSIX P1003.1e/2c DRAFT and it's implications for security features as well as how it created an early cooperative development mindset within the security community. The arrival of Linux and the internet introduce new opportunities. The emergence of Linux Security Modules and their disappointing impact gets mentioned, too. Of course, the move from open systems to open source is next. The move to isolation, using virtualization and namespaces and the inevitable discovery of containers comes next.\r\n\r\nWe wrap up with some predictions of direction and possible disappointments in the future.",

The typical solution to this is that you grab the reference manual for the device, and develop software to achieve what you want. The question is, how do you debug your library when things go wrong? A key component of the debug process is looking at the signals going to the device and confirming that they are what you expect.\r\n\r\nThis workshop provides the user with some basic hardware, and walks them through using the supplied logic analyser to debug a deliberately flawed library.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\nA basic understanding of C/C++. You won't need to write new code, but you should be able to understand and make changes to existing code.\r\nHow to use a breadboard for electronic prototyping. If you haven't used a breadboard before, you can read up on how to use them on Adafruit, paying attention to how they are internally wired: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard\r\nAn understanding of the 1Wire protocol. If you are not familiar with in, this tutorial provides a good description (flash required): https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/1-wire/flash/overview/\r\nA laptop capable of running STLink and Pulseview. Setup instructions for both Windows and Linux are provided. Contributions for OSX are welcome. A minimum of 3 USB ports are required to complete this workshop easily, or 2 with a lot of port swapping. If your laptop has less than 3 available ports, a USB hub is strongly recommended.\r\n\r\nA $35 hardware kit is required to complete this workshop, which you can take home afterwards. It includes an ARM developer board, SWD programmer, 1wire device and logic analyser.\r\n\r\nA total of 50 kits are available. To reserve a seat in the workshop and a hardware kit, please add your name here: https://goo.gl/WGH2rz\r\n\r\nAttendees must have cloned the tutorial git repository and completed the included prerequisites before the start of the workshop: https://github.com/InfernoEmbedded/logicanalyser_workshop\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n- Program an ARM microcontroller using an SWD programmer\r\n- Read output from the microcontroller's serial port\r\n- Learn the basics of the 1Wire protocol\r\n- Use Sigrok to analyse the signal between the microcontroller and the device\r\n- Use Sigrok for higher level protocol analysis\r\n- Use Sigrok to debug device communications",

While Cher and Jane Austen could only have dreamed of holding their wardrobes in their hands, it is now a possibility.\r\n\r\nAudience takeaways will include an overview of creating mobile phone applications with open source tools, a better understanding of the potential for using technology with fashion, and an overall sense of nostalgia for 90s movies.",

      "abstract": "Writing secure applications is hard, and often vulnerabilities are found after your application has already been released to production.\r\n\r\nBut what happens if you\u2019re not able to fix the vulnerabilities quickly? If you don\u2019t have the source code? Or if the vulnerable application is \u201cEnterprise Software\u201d, and you aren\u2019t ever going to be able to fix it? Wouldn\u2019t it be great if the someone else could secure your website for you?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we describe the approach we use to shield customer\u2019s websites when all other avenues have failed, or when urgency requires a fix as soon as possible. This process of virtual patching works well in the real world, and allows people to have comfort that all their known vulnerabilities are fixed and their applications are as secure as can be.\r\n\r\nThis talk demonstrates the process of virtual patching using a suite of open source tooling that you can go back to your company and use straight away - tools like ModSecurity and node.js. Our approach is different to the typical approach of WAF vendors, and avoids false-positives by only patching exact, known vulnerabilities discovered in a penetration test, and so we avoid the risk of affecting legitimate users.\r\n\r\nWe will show how ModSecurity works, including patching some OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities using ModSecurity rules. We will then discuss how to fix more complex business logic flaws by writing javascript code running in node.js. This allows you to rewrite traffic to and from your website, track the state of users, sessions and requests, and fix complex issues that cannot be done using a WAF on it\u2019s own. \r\n\r\nPrior knowledge: This talk assumes understanding of the HTTP protocol, and common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Some experience reading Javascript would be useful, however the examples presented should be explained in a way that makes sense to non-coders.",

      "abstract": "We have cracked the problem of safely combining real-time tasks of different criticality on a single system image, removing the main show-stopper for complex mixed-criticality systems as they are emerging in cyberphysical systems such as autonomous vehicles.\r\n\r\nMixed-criticality systems (MCS) consolidate multiple functionalities of differing criticality (i.e. severity of failure). MCS are already a reality in avionics, although to date with severe restrictions. A core requirement of MCS is that the correct operation, including timeliness, of critical components must not depend on any less critical components. This requires enforcement of strong spatial and temporal isolation by the OS. Given that MCS are often life-critical, this isolation must be truly bullet-proof, and must be able to stop interference by less critical components that are potentially compromised by an attacker.\r\n\r\nThe industry-standard approach, e.g. mandated by avionics standard ARIC 653, uses strict time-and-space partitioning (TSP), where each component is sandboxed in a fixed memory partition and executes according to a statically configured schedule. This approach is too limiting for emerging MCS, as it inherently leads to poor resource utilisation and inhibits sharing across criticalities. Such sharing is important; e.g. in an autonomous aircraft, the less critical ground-station communication component must be able to update waypoints used by the highly-critical flight-control component.\r\n\r\nThe recently released MCS branch of the formally-verified seL4 microkernel is the first OS that truly matches the requirements of MCS. seL4 already provides provable spatial isolation, the MCS branch adds a scheduling model that provides the right temporal isolation. In particular, it provides time budget enforcement, that can prevent high-priority threads from monopolising the processor.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will first give a refresher on seL4 and its formal verification story. I will then discuss the requirements of MCS in detail, based on example use cases, and explain why they cannot be matched by existing systems. I will then present the seL4 MCS support and show how it meets the requirements. I will also present autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) case studies.",

In practice, developers avoid this work because they don't have a good idea of how to start and can't evaluate whether they have succeeded. \r\n\r\nThis workshop is designed to teach you a few basic theories of technical documentation, such as task-based topics, reusable content, and writing for an audience. After the overview, you'll learn techniques for writing bug reports, error messages, and onboarding instructions in a tool-agnostic, repeatable way. You'll leave this workshop with a handful of techniques, templates, and tests that will improve your team\u2019s communication and your life as a developer.",

This is particularly important for historical games, where avoiding stereotypes and aiming for authenticity is crucial. Aiming for accuracy not only makes the game more authentic, but also helps develop and expand the player\u2019s understanding of history. \r\n\r\nWe all know that history can complement video games by creating an interesting setting that the audience is usually at least vaguely familiar with. When you set a game within a historical setting, you get a pre-built rich environment, and you also save time on explaining the player\u2019s surroundings. \r\n\r\nThis talk will be looking at the Assassins Creed franchise and Horizon: Zero Dawn, which both reached out to historians and anthropologists. Both games have extremely different settings, and worked in very different ways to effectively create a feel of authenticity. I will further be discussing how historical and anthropological experts are more than happy to share their knowledge for the sake of historical accuracy, with many believing it to be the future of historical education.",

The \u201cPress Dress\u201d, worn by Matilda Butters in 1860s Melbourne, proclaimed the Liberty of Press at the time, and has, as time passes, become a time capsule that holds stories and histories from the period. The ability to wear history is an appealing and powerful notion. As the GLAM sector opens its collections and enables reuse, the ability to create powerful statements using historical documents is more readily realised. Online guides by digital humanists provide advice and guidance about accessing and reusing open GLAM collections in crafty and creative ways, utilising DIY culture and DIY tools for potentially subversive actions. An open invitation to reuse images of ASIO redactions provided an opportunity to utilise these DIY tools and in the process challenge the idea of access. This story begins and ends with a dress.",

      "abstract": "Memory management with larger memory sizes of around a couple of\r\nterabyte leads to a number of issues that make life hard. This talk is\r\na look at the issues and at the work in progress on these issues.\r\n\r\nFirst, huge pages are not supported for the page cache which leads to\r\nnumerous performance issues. It begins with the long time it takes to\r\njust copy a file of a few gigs in size (minor compared to the size of\r\nthe memory in the system of a few terabytes after all...) to the\r\nperformance problems when accessing large amounts of 4k pages from a\r\nmemory mapped file. Since huge pages are not supported TLB trashing\r\noften becomes an issue. Devices have issues writing large blocks of\r\ndata to disk due to large scatter gather lists having to be processed\r\nin memory. Reclaim becomes slow since the system is literally churning\r\nthrough billions of 4k page to figure out which ones to evict.\r\n\r\nSecond, huge pages cause a memory overhead that surprises users. The\r\nkernel manages 4k chunks of the huge page in many cases and needs to\r\nhave metadata structures for each 4k page. Other metadata also exists.\r\nThis results in gigabytes of memory just not being present. The user\r\nbought a system with a lot of memory but the Linux just cannot use it.\r\n\r\nThird, fragmentation becomes an issue in particular if huge pages and\r\n4k pages are frequently allocated and freed (like we have to because\r\nthe page cache does not support 4k after all).  So over time systems\r\nhave to be rebooted to allow the allocation of huge pages. Huge pages\r\nare actually only a small problem because devices on large systems\r\noften want to allocate large contiguous buffers for I/O (like\r\nspecialized networking devices using RDMA).",

By using signed distance functions, we can describe the geometry of a scene in a succinct mathematical form. Raymarching allows us to step rays closer and closer to our geometry until we intersect and then colour our pixels according to our shading model. This technique is vastly expressive. Scenery from cityscapes to natural landscapes can be produced by aggregating simple mathematical rules. With surprisingly few mathematical operations, you can create remarkable variety, and by supplying temporal inputs like music and motion, you can create procedurally evolving scenery.",

When used effectively as part of a software project's development and build processes, code generation can encourage good practices, reduce bugs, and save valuable developer time by eliminating the need to write boilerplate code by hand. This talk will look at a few use cases for automatic source code generation, and discuss the high-level design principles involved in using, or even rolling your own source code generator.",

The flight logs of our 2016 challenge flights show some rather surprising results with telstra and optus 3G modems, with communications lag far beyond what was expected. The highly redundant network system we used in CanberraUAV was very complex, but proved its worth on the day after our relay aircraft was destroyed.",

I happened to have some weeks shortly after that happened where I was able to do whatever I wanted... and I decided to have some fun and implement an open source look-alike.\r\n\r\nMaglev has some distinctive design choices - such as the use of userspace networking to achieve zero-copy forwarding - which I knew about but had not actively used, as well as doing direct server return - sending packets to backend servers wrapped in GRE, but traffic in the other direction is routed directly, so the traffic pattern is asymmetric.\r\n\r\nSince I was young and foolish then, I thought it would be good to also deepen my knowledge of the Rust language at the same time... and develop it on my not-as-Linux-friendly-as-I'd-like Surface : so my Linux\r\nenvironment was actually a Hyper-V VM.\r\n\r\nThis combination led to discovering some truely fantastic facilities in Rust, bugs in the Linux kernel and the netmap project, and exploring some of the awkwardness where very clever C datastructures don't map well to Rust's ownership model.\r\n\r\nThe current status of the project is that the core use case works: traffic can be forwarded using network ring buffers, without needing a dedicated network card, routed with zerocopy while preserving GRE wrappers. Higher level facilities like dynamic reconfiguration and backend health signalling are not yet implemented (but are designed).\r\n\r\nIn the talk I will cover the choices I made and why - rust vs the world, netmap vs DPDK, things I found surprising about doing userspace networking, detail the gritty details of doing userspace networking with Netmap from Rust, using Rust to parse and create network packets, as well as driving netlink from within Rust. I'll cover the bugs I had to fix in order to write the code I wanted to write.",

So, how do Sydney busses (and third-party bus providers) stack up against each other and the world? To answer these questions we need data\u2026 lots of data.\r\n\r\nHooray for open government data! Transport NSW publishes real-time information on the location and lateness of all public transport. Unfortunately it's ephemeral \u2013 there is no public log of historical lateness for us to analyse. To gather the data I needed I had to fetch, log and aggregate ephemeral real-time data that was never intended to be used this way. There are random gaps and spontaneous route or timetable changes for special events, roadworks or holidays. Even with noisy data, the patterns start to emerge across months.\r\n\r\nPublic transport networks of the world export timetable and real-time data in a (reasonably) consistent format so this process can be applied across cities and countries. Let's see how Sydney stacks up against Melbourne or how Australia stacks up against the world! Perhaps 40min late busses are not an inevitable fact of life.",

      "abstract": "The participation of women in computer education is low; undergraduate enrollment hovers between 10-20% female globally. The picture at the primary school level is fuzzier, as students do not declare majors at that level, but evidence indicates the trend starts from a young age. Can we make computer education more gender-inclusive? Presenting technology in familiar, non-threatening contexts can lead to more balanced gender participation. For example, Chibitronics uses the context of papercraft to present electronics to beginners; the familiarity of papercraft improves the participation of women of all ages in the creation of electronics. \r\n\r\nBased on these learnings, we have devised the \u201cLove to Code\u201d platform, an open source hardware-to-cloud stack which combines the familiarity of paper craft with a web-based, driver-free embedded firmware development environment based on FSK audio provisioning via a headphone jack. In this talk, we will dive into the novel open source technical contributions of this platform, which includes the audio-based provisioning protocol and the unique rigid-flex design of the circuitry enabling papercraft integration, as well as the multi-threaded client OS and cloud infrastructure required to complete the picture. This combination of new technology with familiar interfaces aims to lower the barrier to computer education, thus making coding a more accessible and inclusive activity.",

They project independent images to each\r\neye to construct a stereo view and track the position and orientation\r\nof the head using both inertial measurement and external beacons.\r\n\r\nAll of the elements in the system introduce varying amounts of delay\r\nbetween the motion of the head and the perception of the image by the\r\nuser. Computing the projected images thus requires predicting where\r\nthe user will be facing when the image is finally emitted from the\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\nAs the user is strapped into the HMD and their visual field is limited\r\nto that provided by the HMD, timing errors in the VR presentation can\r\ncause disorientation leading to nausea or other effects. This leads to\r\nstrong latency bounds through the entire application pipeline.\r\n\r\nA traditional window system, running multiple applications, cannot\r\neasily provide the guarantees needed by a VR system. Competing\r\napplications may consume window system resources and cause jitter in\r\nthe VR presentation. Separating the VR application from the window\r\nsystem can allow it to operate without interference from other\r\napplications and improve performance.\r\n\r\nStarted at LCA last year in Hobart, the new DRM Leasing mechanism\r\nallows applications to take over a set of display resources from the\r\nwindow system and drive them directly.

On top of that, other people seem to have the entirely unreasonable expectation to have their computers reliably boot an Operating System, perform consistently, and not catch fire. In order to meet these outrageous expectations, we need to test firmware before we release it to an unsuspecting public.\r\n\r\nAfter all, isn't the gold standard of testing \"if it boots, ship it\" ? In the era of Blockchain, the gold standard no longer applies.\r\n\r\nAs a firmware maintainer, I want the answer to a simple question: \"Will I regret merging this code?\". A simple and quick automated test suite is in order! Unfortunately, such things are not always around when you need them.\r\n\r\nIn order to successfully deliver POWER9 systems (new processor, new operating systems, new machines, new BMC software), we would need a high quality, reliable, fast, easy to use, automated firmware test suite that could not only spot regressions, but find new bugs.\r\n\r\nThis is a tale of code and organizational transformation and discovery during an incredibly tight and largely immobile release schedule.\r\n\r\nWe'll cover:\r\n- Components of a modern POWER server and how one might test them (on purpose or by accident)\r\n- Practical use of Python in a mix of modern and legacy environments without going insane\r\n- (ab)using existing testing frameworks for (almost) fun and (hopefully) profit\r\n- How to (not) live with old enterprise distros\r\n- Transforming development, test, and management organizations, into test focused ones.\r\n- How on earth do you design a firmware compliance test before you have a test suite anyway?\r\n\r\nThis talk is brought to you by:\r\n- A Perl script calling a perl script that parses XML with regex that ran a shell script to construct a python script to shell out to expect.\r\n- Unexpected bugs in the TTY layer\r\n- Soft Lockups\r\n- SOL Disconnected by BMC.",

With Linux reaching into every corner of modern life, and userspace frequently being very locked-down, the kernel has become an ever-increasing target for attackers and much more needs to be done to harden the kernel so it can protect itself. A quick overview will be shown of what we're trying to protect Linux against, as well as the state of the art in available technologies.

      "authors": [
        "Xi Yang"
      ],
      "abstract": "Web services from search to games to stock trading impose strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs) on tail latency. Meeting these objectives is challenging because the computational demand of each request is highly variable and load is bursty. Consequently, many servers run at low utilization (10 to 45%); turn off simultaneous multithread- ing (SMT); and execute only a single service \u2014 wasting hardware, energy, and money. Although co-running batch jobs with latency critical requests to utilize multiple SMT hardware contexts (lanes) is appealing, unmitigated sharing of core resources induces non-linear effects on tail latency and SLO violations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe introduce principled borrowing to control SMT hardware execution in which batch threads borrow core resources. A batch thread executes in a reserved batch SMT lane when no latency-critical thread is executing in the partner request lane. We instrument batch threads to quickly detect execution in the request lane, step out of the way, and promptly return the borrowed resources. We introduce the nanonap system call to stop the batch thread\u2019s execution without yielding its lane to the OS scheduler, ensuring that requests have exclusive use of the core\u2019s resources. We evaluate our approach for colocating batch workloads with latency-critical requests using the Apache Lucene search engine. A conservative policy that executes batch threads only when request lane is idle improves utilization between 90% and 25% on one core depending on load, without compromising request SLOs. Our approach is straightforward, robust, and unobtrusive, opening the way to substantially improved resource utilization in datacenters running latency-critical workloads.",

      "abstract": "Fiction exists to entertain its audience, but it is also fundamental to shaping the evolution of society itself. Much fiction is based around the concept of new ideas; movies like The Matrix had us consider whether our world was a simulation, and the contemporary Westworld has sparked many a discussion about consciousness and personhood.\r\n\r\nYet fiction gives us something even more compelling, and more powerful, than merely exploring new ideas; it gives us stories about how to live our lives. Popular fiction provides society with scripts on what to expect, how to act, what's important in life, how to form relationships, what to aspire to, and commentary and scaffolding on almost every other part of our lives.\r\n\r\nIntertwined with this has been the long, long tradition of writing fan-fiction; using an existing story or world to expand, explore, or re-invent. Disney solidly highlighted the power of fan-fiction by creating animated films that re-interpret fairy tales that were already familiar to audiences. Modern fan-fiction\u2014while sometimes occupying a niche role\u2014has taken this even further; and is now a powerful vehicle for the exploration of new concepts and ways of living our lives.\r\n\r\nThe creation of fan content also provides an important entry-point for many people\u2014especially young women\u2014into technical skills including programming, front-end development, media editing, and content management. We'll examine how current attitudes towards fan-content are directly damaging to diversity in the tech industry, and society as a whole.\r\n\r\nA reading list and further resources will be provided for those wishing to learn more.",

      "name": "What does the buyout of @arduino mean for #openhardware?",
      "authors": [
        "Kathy Giori"
      ],
      "abstract": "@KathyReid tweeted the title of this talk on July 29, 2017, a day after the Arduino buyout was announced. She was suggesting that the topic be submitted to #LCA2018. Having heard from a college friend that LCA is probably the best open source conference on the planet, I thought, why not provide my take?\r\n\r\nI will share stories of Arduino (and Wiring Project) history, including the open licensing decisions that enabled its phenomenal organic growth, worldwide. Inhibitors to continued innovation occurred whenever key Arduino personnel attempted to restrict ecosystem participation (such as limiting microcontroller partners), or limit visibility of Arduino-compatible technology. Internal personnel feuds didn\u2019t help either. It led to two years of lawsuits among co-founders, during which two different \u201cArduino\u201d companies were vying for the trademark, to capture customer loyalty.\r\n\r\nEven after a \u201csettlement\u201d was announced, with smiles and public handshakes shared on social media, the merged structure began with just a 3-person trademark holding company licensing the brand to the two feuding entities that continued to operate independently. They sold different boards, keeping their own profits, and keeping future projects and plans secret. Silicon vendors were confused, still dealing with two entities. To keep new products hidden, software wasn\u2019t developed openly until the product was announced, vastly limiting expert review and collaboration that would have improved the quality, and reduced redundancy of new libraries, drivers, and core features. Similarly, an open and collaborative review of hardware designs, and cross-industry discussions for defining smaller \u201cstandard\u201d form factors, was limited.\r\n\r\nThe buyout eliminates the \u201ctwo Arduino\u201d problem. But will the remaining Arduino team learn from the past and be more accepting of Arduino-compatible alternatives around them? Will the development process become more community-driven, allowing companies like TI to participate instead of feeling obligated to fork the IDE and roll their own? Will Arduino embrace and promote the great diversity of open source software options for programming the Wiring/Arduino framework, such as Snap! (Snap4Arduino), PlatformIO, embedXcode, and others? Will Arduino and compatible board designs remain open? \r\n\r\nI discovered my passion for the open hardware community while working at Qualcomm Atheros, and was already engaged in pushing upstream Linux development of the Atheros Wi-Fi drivers. I met one of the newcomers to Arduino hardware at CES, and supported him with the integration of the AR9331 into the Arduino Yun, the first board to bridge a microprocessor running embedded Linux (OpenWrt) with a microcontroller running the Wiring/Arduino framework. This led to me joining the Arduino.org team, where I forged strategic relationships with additional chip vendors, board manufacturers, and did outreach in education and professional IoT. Due to management issues, I had resigned just before the buyout announcement. But there are reasons to stay involved in the community. Take for example RISC-V -- with an open architecture processor, we\u2019re on the verge of open software, open hardware, *and* open silicon. Come listen to my take on Arduino history and where I think #openhardware can go in the future.",

      "authors": [
        "John Dickinson"
      ],
      "abstract": "Consistent hash rings are often used in distributed storage systems to efficiently compute data placement. However, for efficiency, these hash rings are often implemented with a fixed number of partitions of the key space. This is how OpenStack Swift's data placement algorithm works. Swift's \"part power\" is used to segment, or partition, the consistent hash ring used for placement. The part power is set when the ring is created, and it determines the upper limits of capacity in the cluster.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if the partition count is set too high, there will be excessive overhead in the system and storage capacity will be underutilized. However, if it is set too low, then data placement will get \"lumpy\" and be unevenly distributed across the cluster. An operator is forced to balance these two concerns, often without knowing how much the cluster will grow.\r\n\r\nRecently the Swift community has merged a feature that allows operators to increase the partition power in an existing cluster. This allows operators to set the part power to a low value when the cluster is created and increase it over time as the cluster expands. Implementing this feature is tricky, because the part power is a fundamental part of the data placement algorithm. Changing it can potentially make all of the data in the cluster completely inaccessible. Swift's implementation, however, is able to keep the cluster available during the entire process.\r\n\r\nThis talk will describe the data placement problem, explain how the community implemented the feature, and give a short demo of the feature in action.",

      "abstract": "XFS has been in production for more than 20 years and has been in the linux\r\nkernel for 15 of them - it is the oldest of the current mainstream\r\nLinux filesystems. The design of XFS was state of the art in the late 1980s,\r\nwhen btrees, extents and journalling were shiny new concepts. While development\r\nof XFS still continues, it's design and architecture is largely unchanged. many\r\nof the tricks that XFS brought to Linux can now be found in other Linux\r\nfilesystems, too. It's the old dog of the pack.\r\n\r\nWe recently introduced a late-90s technology to XFS: shared data extents and a\r\ncopy-on-write IO path. The copy-on-write tree structure that first appeared in\r\nthe late 90s can be found in ZFS and BTRFS, but not XFS. So while XFS can now\r\nprovide some data manipulations like clones and deduplication, it doesn't provide\r\nany of the more advanced CoW functionality like snapshots that traditional CoW\r\nfilesystems inherently provide.\r\n\r\nGiven that XFS doesn't have a copy-on-write architecture, can we use the new\r\nfunctionality to provide a similar feature set to native COW filesystems? What\r\nother old tricks do we need to pull out of the bag to make this a reality? And\r\nhow much will the result look like XFS?\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll outline my crazy plan to add filesystem management concepts to\r\nXFS that only copy-on-write filesystems current provide to Linux users. There\r\nwon't be anything \"new\" here - I'll describe the old tech that inspired the\r\nalgorithms and structures that we'll use and, more importantly, some of the\r\npitfalls and hard lessons learned from the original implementations of these\r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\nWith any luck, I'll present a coherent story of how we are going to bring\r\nsubvolumes, snapshots, writeable clones, send/receive remote snapshot\r\nreplication, page cache sharing and more to XFS without needing to change it's\r\nunderlying 1980s architecture.  XFS may be an old dog, but there's still some\r\nold tricks we can teach it to keep it shiny, new and relevant to users for years\r\nto come.",

So one might think that the Linux kernel would have long since completely adapted itself to the realities of virtualization.\r\n\r\nOne would be wrong.\r\n\r\nVirtualization provides additional challenges to concurrent code, for example due to the hypervisor preempting \"preempt-disabled\" guest-OS code, and even preempting guest-OS code that is under the naive delusion that interrupts have been disabled.  Such preemption can amplify concurrency bugs, and such amplification becomes all the more destructive as people become comfortable with increasing levels of consolidation, resulting in higher CPU utilization and in turn higher probabilities and durations for hypervisor preemption.\r\n\r\nThis talk will look at a few RCU changes that virtualization has motivated and might motivate in the future.",

They are also unavailable in some of the worlds biggest markets, such as China, due to being blocked by the Government.\r\n\r\nF-Droid is the open source app store for Android focusing on freedom, privacy, and security.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't track what you search for, what you install install, or what apps you use. It warns you about apps which track you or show you ads. The main F-Droid repository gives you access to over 2000 open source apps, and there are other 3rd party repositories which expand this even further. In addition, it is essentially unblock-able, making it a vital piece of infrastructure for activists and journalists who need access to apps to facilitate secure communication.\r\n\r\nOver the last year, the F-Droid project has completely revamped its UI to make it more friendly to non-tech users, adding support for screenshots, feature graphics, and localized metadata about apps. We have also added several new tools to make it easier for anybody to setup and run their own curated app store. This talk will cover the various aspects of the project, focussing on the client, its security model, and how it is being used to ensure everyone is able to access high quality open source apps as the smart phone revolution continues.",

In this talk we\u2019re going to allow you to have your cake (or cookie :-) and eat it too.  The concepts and techniques have been successfully applied to large scale, high performance sites; but, while developed for Magento, they also apply to other eCommerce platforms and Content Management Systems.\r\n\r\nI will discuss a technique called \u201ccookie cutter\u201d for personalising cached content.  This technique allows the use of a Full Page Cache (such as Varnish) for performance, while still allowing personalised content such as recently viewed product, name, or number of items in your cart to be included in the page.  Typical solutions to personalisation involve the use of Edge Side Includes (ESI), but there are limitations to that approach, so we\u2019ll talk about ESI, and why \u201ccookie cutter\u201d can be a better solution.\r\n\r\nWhat about cache misses?

This tutorial is aimed at those with some Rust experience, but if you're a total beginner, you'll still learn a lot about what Rust programming is like in practice.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial will start with programming 'in the small': we'll explore some key library types (Option, Result, and Iterator) and cover practical error handling. Putting these together we'll see how to structure your control flow to write clear, succinct programs. We'll then cover some larger-scale design issues - using ownership as a primary architectural principle, and abstraction using traits.\r\n\r\nYou'll learn how to be more productive in Rust by writing clean and idiomatic code.

Either way, I'll demystify the process of writing a talk, submitting it to the right calls for papers, and making sure everyone in the audience leaves the room knowing something new.",

      "abstract": "So you're running a Linux desktop, and it's getting cluttered. There's that weird library you installed ages ago that messes up your package dependencies every upgrade, proprietary software that was last updated for the Ubuntu version you ran three years ago, and then of course you also need a bunch of Python, Go, and Ruby dev environments that all come with their own package managers. Wouldn't it be nice to have a cleaner, saner, more compartmentalised setup?\r\n\r\nEnter LXC.\r\n\r\nLXC is the underrated wallflower of Linux container runtimes. It's been around for longer than just about everything else, it's stable, it has a decent userland, and it comes with neat features that make it saner and more secure than its contenders \u2014 but very few people use it to its full potential.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, I'll show you how to run an arbitrary number of LXC containers on your desktop, all configured with Ansible so that whenever a container starts to look even remotely off, you can just throw it away and start over in minutes. You'll learn how to run unprivileged containers under your own user context, use a shared /home directory across all your containers (and make it work), run containerized X applications that talk to your host X and sound server, and selectively make host resources (such as a webcam, or USB printer) available in your container. I've been using this approach on my own Ubuntu desktop for a couple of years, on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nTo make the most of this tutorial, please come with a desktop that already has LXC and a current version of Ansible installed.",

Combined with cgroups, namespaces form the basis of Linux containers, a form of lightweight virtualization which shares a single kernel image. \r\n\r\nWhile namespacing support has been implemented for several key kernel resources, security components of the kernel such as LSMs (Linux Security Modules) currently lack namespacing support.  This presents many challenges for those wishing to deploy full-system containers, which appear to the user to be operating system instances, but which are in fact subject to global security mechanisms and policies.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss the work in progress to extend Linux kernel namespacing support to SELinux, to allow full-system containers to load their own individual security policies into an virtualized instance of the SELinux kernel mechanism.  This work is based on prototype patches posted by the NSA a few months ago,  which I've been extending to cover file labeling support as one of several current TODO items.\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss how the core SELinux components have been virtualized, the namespacing of xattr-based inode security labels, and future challenges for this project.",

We can then visually examine both our systems performance and all events occurring on it over time with Kibana. This is a near complete open source monitoring solution for a Linux system.  \r\n\r\nAssuming the demo gods allow, We'll have a little bit of a play with our systems, by inducing CPU/memory load or spamming log lines to see it reacts in Kibana, and correlate the different sources of information together in a single Kibana dashboard, providing a relatively complete view of what is happening on the system.  \r\n\r\nFinally, anything missing we want to monitor or record we can do by writing our own Filebeat or Metricbeat module. So we will take a dive into the code to see how you can contribute your own Filebeat or Metricbeat module to these projects.",

They can benchmark their datasets against 350+ high quality, manually curated datasets. They can also use Stemformatics to look across these datasets to find interesting biological patterns.\r\n\r\nFollowing are components in Stemformatics ecosystem :\r\n\r\nPipelines (to process data across different platforms)\r\nData Portal (processed data can be pushed to Data Portal, from where any one who has access can grab data for their personal use)\r\nStemformatics (website to visualize and perform analysis on data )\r\nOmicxview (website to view metabolomic pathways)\r\n\r\nComponents:\r\n\r\nPIPELINES -  Pipelines are used to normalized raw data shared by Biologist. Currently we have pipelines for microarrays, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, miRNA and ATAC-Seq.\r\n\r\nDATA PORTAL - It is a data repository that has an API which is used to grab data from repository, and front end to search on different datasets and download multiple files. This is currently in alpha but is critical as 29% of datasets we process fail our quality control.\r\n\r\nSTEMFORMATICS - The Stemformatics web server is open source and uses the Pylons web framework with an Apache reverse proxy server and Redis cache.\r\n\r\nOMICXVIEW - It is an open source and uses the Pyramid web framework with an Apache reverse proxy server. This tool is built for Biologists to help them visualize metabolic pathways in their data.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\n\r\nSimple and straightforward Code - At Stemformatics, we believe in writing simple, clear and straightforward code to make it easier for everyone to interpret and easier to maintain. \r\nWe use functional approach rather than using object-oriented as it helps us in writing simple code where data inputs are given and data inputs are received.\r\n\r\nSpeed - To provide a good user experience, speed is of utmost importance and in Stemformatics, we use redis cache to provider faster data access. Though it adds little bit of complexity to the code as we have to store data based on each user id, but then it's more like trade-off between speed vs complexity. \r\n\r\nUsing MVC structure - We use Model-View-Controller framework where main logic is sitting in Models that are big and fat, while the Controllers are thin and skinny, and call these models to access the logic and return data based on that. View provides front-end to User. \r\n\tThe strategy behind having fat model and thin controller is to be able to easily migrate the application to to another web framework such as pyramid or django.\r\n\r\nCall To Action:\r\n\r\nAll our projects are open source and can be forked from bitbucket. We would to hear from other people who would like to review or contribute to towards our projects.\r\n\r\nPipeline - Help make our pipelines more efficient at processing raw data\r\nData Portal - Help us to add more integrations with the Stemformatics Web Server\r\nWeb Server - Help us with ideas on looking across datasets",

The messiness of real data makes this challenging, but hope is not lost!\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss design decisions made in existing open source libraries, and highlight the tools and techniques for designing practical and general purely functional libraries to work with these formats, while maintaining the benefits of strong static typing. We will learn about Encode and Decode type classes, zippers, and some different philosophies about error handling. We will see what differences exist in the application of these tools to nested and tabular data formats.\r\n\r\nAn attendee will leave this talk with an understanding of the design of a modern functional encoding and decoding library.

New tools will be added to your toolbelt for when you come up against a data format and need to write your own library.",

      "abstract": "The pace of technology in our industry continues to accelerate, particularly in the infrastructure space. In recent years, every new technology worth mentioning in infrastructure has been complex, distributed, and built for scale: OpenStack, Ceph, Kubernetes, Cumulus Linux, OVN... the list goes on.\r\n\r\nAs customers demand that infrastructure providers make these technologies available, and as those providers themselves identify the need to deploy them, you would think that the primary challenges they face are scalability, time-to-market, or cost. That is not the case. The primary challenge is finding people who know and understand these systems: we're dealing with a skills gap, not a technology gap.\r\n\r\nThis means that we need novel ways to educate professionals on these technologies. One excellent way of doing this is to use the capabilities of the Open edX platform to integrate it with hands-on, on-demand lab environments that can be just as complex, and just as distributed, as production systems. This allows anyone interested to develop a professional skill set on technologies like OpenStack, Ceph, or Kubernetes at minimal cost, from anywhere, and without the need for costly hardware platforms for evaluation. My team and I have operated several such platforms, including our own hastexo Academy and SUSE's SUSE Academy, for a couple of years, and we have made several contributions to the AGPL Open edX stack in the process. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll give an overview over the Open edX stack, the hastexo XBlock (the component that enables on-demand labs hosted in public clouds), and educational considerations for self-paced, on-line learning as they apply to professional training.",

My presentation is aimed at technical people who are curious about, or considering starting a business. It covers some of the lessons learned from bootstrapping a new self-sufficient free/open source project.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll cover:\r\n* What compelled me to do this and what was 'the problem to solve'?\r\n* How did I expect to earn income?\r\n* When and why did I quit my day job? (how to distinguish between a hobby project and a business)\r\n* Is there a conflict between community-building and profit-seeking?\r\n* How can we mitigate the risk and burden of IP, copyright and all that jazz and get back to solving technical problems?\r\n* How do you know who your customers are? (Your itch is not everyone else's itch.)\r\n* What kind of financial planning and support made this possible and could I try again?\r\n* Where did I find help?\r\n* What did a typical day look like?\r\n* What were some of the main challenges and obstacles I faced?\r\n* Who do I look to for inspiration and examples of success?\r\n* Is going solo complete madness? Did I have to wear my underpants on the outside?\r\n* When/why did I stop and go back to a day job?\r\n* How did this project make me a more attractive employee?\r\n* What is it like to be an employee again?\r\n* Would I do it again or would I recommend it to anyone else?\r\n\r\nThe aim of this presentation is to offer encouragement and to point out potential pitfalls of starting an open source software business.

With subsequent the rise of open source configuration management systems, websites sprung up so that common configurations, like Puppet modules and Chef recipes, from these systems could be shared between organizations using them in production.\r\n\r\nToday, following a rush to cloud, companies are now looking for open source tooling to build cloud-like environments in their own new data centers. Technologies like OpenStack and DC/OS, powered by Apache Mesos, are allowing them to replicate much of the functionality that was previously only available with proprietary, hosted solutions. Taking this one step further, several open source projects and organizations have begun full-scale open sourcing of their infrastructures, allowing other organizations to directly benefit from their Continuous Integration tooling and more. Complete infrastructures have now become open source projects unto themselves, and operations engineers becoming more experienced open source contributors, alongside their developer colleagues.\r\n\r\nJoin me in look back through the history of why we chose to go with open source, and what it can teach us today as we evaluate building our applications against cloud platforms, APIs and more. I'll explore what questions should be asked before selecting a platform, some of the open source options available, and share examples of what organizations have gained by being very open about how they've built their infrastructure.",

      ],
      "abstract": "System suspend is relatively straightforward from the user perspective.\r\nWhen requested, it should put the whole system into a state with all\r\nactivity stopped and reduced power draw.  Next, the system should wait\r\nin that state for an event to wake it up and then go back to its previous\r\nstate and get on with whatever it was doing before, ideally without any\r\nside-effects visible to the user.  The implementation of that in an\r\nOperating System, however, turns out to be seriously complicated.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, stopping all activity in a multiprocessor system, like\r\na modern laptop, is a rather tricky business and it cannot take too\r\nmuch time, or it will not be appreciated by users.  On top of that,\r\nin general, all devices in the system need to be put into low-power\r\nstates, so that the total power draw of the suspended system can be\r\nas low as expected and that should happen quickly too.  Still, some\r\ndevices need to remain sufficiently active to be able to wake up the\r\nsystem when needed and that has to be taken into account along with\r\nall of the possible dependencies between devices.  Moreover, the time\r\nit takes for the system to get back to the working state also cannot be\r\ntoo long and, finally, all of the above must be absolutely reliable\r\nor system suspend will not be used.  Combined, all of these items\r\nmay look a bit intimidating.\r\n\r\nOf course, that did not prevent Linux kernel developers from implementing\r\nsystem suspend support, but it took quite some time to reach the current\r\nstate of the art.  Various parts of the suspend infrastructure have been\r\nunder development for several years, but it started to be recognized as\r\na separate feature in 2007.\r\n\r\nOverall, a lot of progress has been made and nowadays system suspend\r\nin Linux is regarded as one of the features that generally should work.\r\nThere are gaps in it and occasional regressions happen, but also there\r\nis a huge number of Linux-based systems in the field that suspend\r\nreliably on a very regular basis.  However, it is instructive and\r\nsomewhat entertaining to look back at where we started and how we\r\nhave got where we are today.\r\n\r\nThat leads to some interesting observations.  One of them, which seems to\r\nbe particularly important to me, is that improvements are made by iterating\r\nthree basic steps again and again.  First, we get some better understanding\r\nof what really happens, either by diagnosing reported issue or by adding\r\nsupport for new technologies.  That better understanding results in code\r\nimprovements which typically unlock some use cases that were not viable\r\npreviously.  Next, the new use cases are exercised and become the source\r\nof feedback which then causes our understanding of things to get better\r\nstill and a new cycle begins.  Every iteration takes us to the next level\r\nand progress is made this way.\r\n\r\nThat pattern is clearly visible in the history of the development of\r\nsystem suspend support in Linux, but it is not the only thought-provoking\r\naspect of it as I will show in my presentation.",

Conway\u2019s Law is a separate tradition in technology, embracing our idioms and ways of storytelling.  \r\n\r\nBut all three traditions point back to the same underlying concepts. \r\n\r\nConway\u2019s Law has been studied across auto, aviation, software, banking, and healthcare. Each study has revealed how humans organise to build systems, and how those systems influence how we organise ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe results are not what you\u2019d expect.\r\n\r\nThe internet has completely changed how we communicate \u2013 the cost of communication is lower than ever. Open Source breaks new ground about how we organise ourselves when working together.   How Conway\u2019s Law applies to open source development will surprise you. \r\n  \r\nPeople who attend this talk will learn:\r\n  \r\n* A brief history of Conway\u2019s Law in management literature and academia.\r\n* How Conway\u2019s Law applies differently to your open source community and your workplace.\r\n* How to apply the evidence to help you grow and sustain your community in a fast evolving ecosystem.",

When is it better to stick to a single-master system with failover? If you do select a multi-master system, what kind is best for you? Do you need something partition- and latency-tolerant, or something tightly coupled and transparent? Shared-mostly or shared-nothing?

      ],
      "abstract": "It's time to build for the web, again.\r\n\r\nIt was declared dead[1], largely in favour of native apps. But the web, the biggest and most open platform we have, is fighting back[2]\u2014it's caught up with features only available in proprietary, native APIs, including making websites feel more 'app-like'. Sure, native development has it's place\u2014but only if you're big, or lucky. For you as a developer, the web provides a frictionless way to reach users (while providing 'app-like features') all via a single href.\r\n\r\nFor a history lesson: in 2007, smartphones hit the mainstream. Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone. At the time, Apple famously (albeit briefly) resisted \"apps\", instead directing developers to 'write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps'[3].\r\n\r\nOf course, native apps quickly came to dominate, as we now have closed app ecosystems on these billions on mobile devices. This is not without good cause; it's difficult to imagine the next trendy social platform or addictive, casual game appearing as anything but \"the latest native app\". On the other hand, these ecosystems are dominated by a few behemoths. The average mobile user spends the majority of their time in just a few apps\u2014no prizes for guessing what they are\u2014and installs an average of zero[5] or one[6] new app per month.\r\n\r\nBut the web has maintained its incredible reach since before the Age of Apps. Sites that deliver content have been able to do it whether the user's browser was automatically updated last night or is an unpatched mess of security holes from several years ago.\r\n\r\nModern, 'evergreen'[4] browsers\u2014like Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari\u2014have also helped drive a rapid iteration of APIs on the web. These are the 'triple-A' of browsers, and as developers, we can target them via the best of the best APIs\u2014because we can be confident they're up to-date\u2014while shipping the same or a similar website to old browsers. This all works because, fundamentally, HTML is still the same as it was ten or even twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nToday, we can build what's called a \"Progressive Web App\", or PWA. This describes a site using the group of APIs that let the web act in an 'app-like' way\u2014but more importantly, it's the phrase you tell your manager or your investors who only want \"an app\"! These APIs include:\r\n* Websites that work and load on a poor or or offline connection\r\n* That can push native notifications to users (where accepted)\r\n* And which can have an icon on a user's home screen, or in any place an 'App' might appear\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll show you how to create a Progressive Web App and demonstrate the APIs that make up this definition, and talk about the future of the standard, open web.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.wired.com/2010/08/ff_webrip/\r\n[2]: https://www.wired.com/2016/04/wait-web-isnt-really-dead-google-made-sure/\r\n[3]: https://9to5mac.com/2011/10/21/jobs-original-vision-for-the-iphone-no-third-party-native-apps/\r\n[4]: http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/evergreen-browsers/\r\n[5]: https://www.recode.net/2016/9/16/12933780/average-app-downloads-per-month-comscore\r\n[6]: https://www.tune.com/blog/no-the-average-american-does-not-download-0-apps-each-month/",

It might be you, if you're in a \"DevOps\" culture, or it might be some graveyard shift junior sysadmin who got stuck with the pager.\r\n\r\nWhoever it is who gets the call, there are a variety of tools and techniques you can apply to your code to make it easier to isolate the location of the fault, determine the cause and identify possible mitigations and fixes.\r\n\r\nThis talk will go through the basics of why things break, how problems are found and fixed, and the few small changes in how systems and services are developed that can make a big difference to the ease of finding problems, and the time it takes to get a problematic service back on its feet.

The\r\ninternet abounds with information on creating your first patch, someone (*cough*\r\nme) even blogs, and presents, on doing your first patch set. But one patch does\r\nnot a kernel developer make, nor one patch set.\r\n\r\nThis talk is aimed at developers wishing to get started working on the kernel\r\nbut unable to find things to work on. You will hopefully walk away with\r\nincreased enthusiasm and confidence that you can find something interesting and\r\ntractable to work on within the kernel.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss the idea that barriers to kernel development are primarily\r\nsocial not technical. You can expect some suggestions on how to manoeuvre within\r\nthe kernel development process and some tips for maximizing your chances of\r\nsuccess. Their will be a brief discussion on motivation - nothing hard can be\r\nachieved without the motivation to do so. \r\n\r\nYou can hope to learn how to find, and interact with, other more experienced\r\nkernel developers and how that can assist you in finding the solution that works\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\nYou can _however_ also hope to gain some concrete technical suggestions for\r\ngetting started with kernel development and finding things to work on.\r\n\r\nTobin is a hobbyist kernel developer. Whilst achieving a very small amount of\r\nsuccess he has experienced many obstacles that can be lumped together under the\r\nproblem of 'finding something to work on'. It is his hope that you can gain from\r\nthis and find yourself happily hacking away on interesting kernel problems.",

No matter how many video tutorials or books I referred, it is still quite hard to think functionally. Worse, I would finally understand what monads are but still hit a road-block when I try implementing them.\r\n\r\nHow could I truly understand and use FP? First, I read every book on FP I could get my hands on. Second, I attended every discussion and meetup even remotely related to FP. Third, I started writing functional code for my company. That last one was wishful thinking and a fast route to feeling disheartened.\r\n\r\nLearning FP should be fun and I was able to do this by building mini projects or games around the concepts I was learning. I played around with all those fancy functors and applicatives I read about. Granted it was slow going and it means I couldn't jump straight into writing production code. However, this method helped prevent the sobbing and pulling-your-hair-out stage of learning FP.\r\n\r\nThis talk discusses my FP learning adventures as a grad developer with the help of a highly active FP community in REA. It delves into practice projects like the cows and bulls game and toy robots that change with every iteration. Further, it touches upon some quirks and ah-ha! moments that makes me appreciate writing functional code.",

But for various technical reasons there's still a number of security critical components that are entirely unverified and which can be replaced by an attacker, and that means anyone with access to your system can configure it to steal (say) your hard drive encryption password. That's suboptimal.\r\n\r\nThere are various solutions to this involving TPMs, but so far they've all involved a lot of manual configuration and run the risk of being locked out of your machine for upgrading your kernel at the wrong time. Surely we can do better?\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, yes. This presentation will describe some light modifications to the way distributions ship components that will make it possible to ensure that systems boot without running the risk of sensitive credentials being stolen but also without compromising the flexibility of the existing Linux boot process.",

Developed as part of the Reproducible Builds effort, it gets to the bottom of what makes files truly different.

The new regulation stipulated that passenger\r\nvehicle cockpit displays should show detect hazards behind a vehicle\r\nand be capable of producing video composited with warnings within 2\r\nseconds of a driver placing the shifter into reverse.  Achieving this\r\ngoal was quite a challenge for a Linux system starting from a\r\npowered-off state!  Carmakers who planned to ship Linux responded with\r\nan all-out effort to understand the boot process and reduce the\r\ntime-to-video.  Those engineers who participated learned a great deal\r\nabout how Linux starts.\r\n\r\nWhat does actually happen when the power button is pushed on a Linux\r\ndevice?  What are initrd's, BIOSes and bootloaders, and why do we need\r\nthem?  There has been much controversy about PID 1 and SecureBoot, but\r\nmuch less discussion about the work the kernel performs before\r\nreaching userspace: probing devices, allocating memory and starting\r\nper-core housekeeping threads.  The kernel actually does have a\r\nmain.c, but what's in it?  How does initialization of the kernel\r\ncompare to that of normal Linux processes, and how do normal processes\r\nactually start anyway?  Kernel actions are sequenced via a series of\r\n'initcall' stages.  Why do devices show multiple different boot\r\nanimations and screen resolutions?  How are 'suspend' and 'hibernate'\r\ndifferent?\r\n\r\nThe talk will lightly touch on topics like initialization of hardware,\r\nhow resume after hibernation differs from a fresh boot, what 'warm\r\nboot' and 'cold boot' are, and x86_64 versus ARM initialization.  As\r\ntime permits, the talk will include simple demos of how to examine\r\nyour kernel with GDB, how to survive the rescue shell, how to build\r\nyour own initrd and why you might want to do so, and a few ways to\r\npass information between the kernel and the bootloader.\r\n\r\nThe technical level will be appropriate for system administrators and\r\ndevelopers who have some familiarity with installing Linux systems or\r\nrecovering them when they are stuck.

You can build a responsive user interface \r\nthat has custom map displays remarkably easily.\r\n\r\nMost of us carry a geolocation device on us at all times.

      "abstract": "Development and testing of the OpenStack project operates at a tremendous scale, with hundreds of code repositories and thousands of contributors interacting continuously. The infrastructure to support this has to operate at an equally large scale to ensure that it is not outpaced by the volume of upstream development activity. Enabling users and other consumers to see what is happening in real time in this increasingly complex infrastructure becomes equally complex and large. This is why we need interfaces available to develop tooling to handle this.\r\n\r\nMQTT best known for it's use in IoT and sensor network applications also provides a number of advantages when used as an event bus for infrastructure services. For the OpenStack developer and community infrastructure we introduced firehose.openstack.org to provide a unified message bus. Built using MQTT and Mosquitto, firehose is an interface where services can publish events.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover how you can use MQTT as a unified event bus for infrastructure services. It will explain some basics of the MQTT protocol and why it's well suited for this application. It will also use the OpenStack community infrastructure's firehose as a case study to explain the benefits and how a similar system can be used for their your own needs, experimentation and innovation.",

Hopefully this will encourage you to start using lenses, which will help, and pique the interest of some you to actually dive into underlying theory.

While it's never been easier to get access to development tools, like Unity, Cocos 2D, or Godot, the act of creating a game remains a huge amount of effort. Getting others to help can be the difference between shipping something great, and an abandoned project.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll talk about how open-sourcing chunks of your game during development can both help your fellow game devs, and help you build your own game faster. We'll talk about how Night in the Woods (2017) open-sourced parts of itself during development, and discuss a workflow for continuously open-sourcing parts of your game during production.",

      "abstract": "Every system has problems.  Programs gain unwanted vulnerabilities, hardware does not play nicely with software, configurations conflict, and things just slow down.  Part of the job of a sysadmin has been to try to keep up with the bewildering deluge of fixes, performance tweaks, configuration updates and new incompatibilities that we seem to get every day.  Many of us just leave things broken because we didn't know they weren't working, or didn't know there was a fix for that problem.\r\n\r\nUntil now.\r\n\r\nRed Hat has created a framework called Insights which aims to help sysadmins keep on top of fixing things.  It gathers information from a system and then uses rules to test for conditions known to cause problems.  This can be simple, such as checking the version of an installed package, or as complex as the rule writer desires.  Insights provides a powerful system to be able to notify the user of a problem but actually provide a solution that is customised to that system.  Multiple rule sets can be easily combined to get the best of both community and in-house knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn this talk Paul will present Insights, give an overview of how it works, and demonstrate how the community can get on board with contributing rules.",

      "abstract": "By necessity, embedded systems often use low power, cheap parts - which means that the device that flies your drone or keeps your heart beating is likely not to have a Memory Management Unit. This means that the usual protection provided by virtual memory against programming errors or untrustworthy code is absent - any task can access all memory.\r\n\r\nMicrocontroller designers recognised this problem and started to tack on a cheaper Memory Protection Unit instead. Memory partitions can be created by the programmer using the MPU to protect the kernel, real-time tasks and other data from each other - however using it effectively is not easy.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present how we implemented support for the MPU in ARM's Cortex-M series of microprocessors (a popular choice for low-power embedded designs) in eChronos, an open-source real-time operating system. It will explore how that support can be used to protect one task's data from another, the kernel from the payload tasks, and for other purposes - like sandboxing questionable third-party drivers. The implementation process was not straightforward - with many scrapped design prototypes, and traps for the unwary. Our experience represents an attempt to make the MPU usable without undue burden on the programmer using the system, and without compromising real-time properties. Other points in the design space will be discussed, along with our reasoning as to the implementation decisions we made.\r\n\r\nA number of live hardware demonstrations (attempting to compromise MPU-less and MPU-protected systems) will be given throughout the talk.",

Why isn't anyone using it?  Or perhaps they are, and we don't know it because it Just Works?  We'll dissect the guts of this protocol, examine its strengths and weaknesses, compare it to some other popular service discovery systems, and based on practical operational experience, decide if everyone should be adopting this quiet achiever.",

      "abstract": "Building web applications rapidly is pretty easy in 2017. Lots of great tools and frameworks are available to streamline development by reusing code for common scenarios.\r\n\r\nBut as software teams grow it becomes increasingly difficult to coordinate effort. We might find ourselves trading off team autonomy with alignment to the business goals and perhaps oscillate around an evasive balancing point. Without a clear strategy the codebase underlying our product can become singular monstrosities. Dev teams shout out to \"break up the monolith!\", technical debt mounts and progress slows.\r\n\r\nThe concept of micro-services (or \"service-oriented\" architecture) has risen in popularity in recent years as a means to break large pieces of software (\"monoliths\") up into smaller parts and allow for team specialisations or more obvious division of responsibilities.\r\n\r\nHowever, micro-services also come with some significant challenges. In many cases simply deciding on the responsibilities of each service can be a tedious and confusing process. Systems that require many underlying services can make deployment complex and risky. Product changes that cut across many services add steps to the development workflow and increase the effort needed to effectively test and release code.\r\n\r\nGrappling with these growing pains, the team at Expert360 decided to take the best ideas from micro-services and combine them with more traditional approaches into a \"Modular Monolith\"; an emerging strategy that addresses many common challenges.\r\n\r\nThe approach is made possible by the Elixir programming language and its underlying \"BEAM\" virtual machine; the same system used in most telecommunication switching networks.",
