FOSS communities also already overlap significantly with many other activist communities, and are working to develop cross-movement connections as well as useful tools. However, many FOSS communities, and particularly those defined by a commitment to open source, rather than than free, software, are reluctant to take overt political stands.

Its tools can trace both the kernel and your userspace applications, allowing you to link operation in your application to the action of the operating system. It use the standard kernel trace instrumentation, so you don\u2019t need to patch and recompile your kernel.

The low overhead of the tracer allows you to run it on production system without affecting the performance of your applications.\r\n\r\nLTTng is also supported by powerful visualization tools which can give you a quick summary of the state of your system or a detailed timeline of each significant operation with a nanosecond precision.

Anyone who says they do likely hasn't had to maintain rulesets at scale, and if they have, they've almost certainly used some sort of tool that does the heavy lifting for them. \r\n\r\nEnter Ript, a clean and opinionated Domain Specific Language for describing firewall rules, that implements database migrations-like functionality for applying these rules with zero downtime.\r\n\r\nAt Ript's core is an easy to use Ruby DSL for describing both simple and complex sets of iptables firewall rules. After defining the hosts and networks you care about, Ript's DSL provides helpers for all the common use cases: accepting, dropping, & rejecting packets, as well as for performing DNAT and SNAT. \r\n\r\nHere is an example ruleset definition: \r\n\r\n# partitions/joeblogsco.rb\r\npartition \"joeblogsco\" do\r\n  label \"www.joeblogsco.com\", :address => \"72.14.191.216\"\r\n  label \"app-01\",             :address => \"10.60.1.230\"\r\n\r\n  rewrite \"public website + ssh access\" do\r\n    ports 80, 22\r\n    dnat  \"www.joeblogsco.com\" => \"app-01\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nRipt provides a method to group common sets of rules together called \"partitions\", which are used at rule application time to perform zero-downtime migrations. This fosters a much more agile approach to firewall changes that limits the size and helps increase the frequency of changes - core principles behind Continuous Delivery. \r\n\r\nRipt is designed from the ground up to be easy to use, and is extremely well tested end-to-end.

This talk covers how we use and alter (and hopefully help to improve) Linux and other Open Source projects to create a fast and stable petascale machine.\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n - How we boot and run clusters at large scale using oneSIS, CentOS, root on Lustre, ...\r\n - How we tweak the kernel and tune the OS to keep them stable and efficient\r\n - Problems we've seen and areas we'd like to see improved\r\n\r\nOur current supercomputer is 12k Nehalem cores with a 20GB/s filesystem and QDR InfinBand. The next machine (hopefully operational by LCA time) is 60k Sandy Bridge cores with a 100GB/s filesystem and FDR InfiniBand. Each of our new clusters is usually in the top 50 machines in the world.\r\n\r\noneSIS and the Lustre filesystem together with CentOS running vanilla and modified RHEL6 kernels are the primary components of our software stack. Uniquely the OS's for all 3600 nodes boot from a single copy of the OS that resides on the global Lustre filesystem. This gives us an easily updatable OS and guarantees all compute nodes are booting identical software.\r\n\r\nHigh performance and predictability is a key focus. The main player in this game is numa awareness. We use cpusets extensively and enforce processor and memory binding to obtain ideal numa alignment and optimal and reproducible job performance. We have worked with the OpenMPI project to get binding included, and our users run jobs with binding on by default.\r\n\r\nWe are increasingly using cgroups and eventually may use all of cputime, freeze/thaw, acl, namespaces, and memcg - all tasks which our own resource manager software currently handles. We also have a history and interest in page migration which may again become useful to reduce machine fragmentation as each numa zone gets more cores.\r\n\r\nLike many HPC sites we write our own job and cluster monitoring tools and these are available for other sites to use and modify, as are our changes to kernels and some InfiniBand tools.

This feature is provided by the CPU hotplug infrastructure in the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nCPU hotplug has now come to have many more usecases than what it was originally designed for. Some of the important ones are RAS (to offline malfunctioning CPUs on a running system), power management (to hotplug CPUs based on the load/utilization for aggressive power savings), RT (for isolation of RT workloads), Suspend/Resume (uses CPU hotplug during both suspend and resume), SMP booting, dynamic partition resizing on powerpc/s390 architectures etc.\r\n\r\nThe current design and implementation of CPU hotplug in Linux has encountered some significant challenges owing to the newer and wider usecases which were not foreseen earlier. Some of them are: less-than-expected performance in several new usecases, race conditions and deadlock possiblities in new scenarios, unacceptable latency for RT workloads and so on. Also, the CPU hotplug design and code has slowly developed into a convoluted mess, making it hard to maintain and improve. This has become a significant problem as highlighted by the fact that it has hindered progress on several occasions [1][2].\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a need to redesign CPU hotplug for both elegance and efficiency, which can help us reap benefits such as fast booting, faster suspend/resume, and more efficient power management. This talk will present an overview of the current usecases and challenges with CPU hotplug and discuss some of the new designs being explored in the community for improving the CPU hotplug framework.\r\n\r\n----\r\n[1]. There is a lot of CPU hotplug related code duplication in almost all architectures that support SMP, and worse, these implemenations have plenty of bugs. This caused boot failures on several architectures when a simple change was made to how the scheduler dealt with CPU hotplug.\r\n\r\n[2]. Recently, a patch was posted in the community to speed-up booting by trying to boot CPUs asynchronously with the rest of the kernel initialization.

The approach supports such diverse type features as structural type specification and comparison, higher-order functions, extensible object typing, function currying, algebraic data types, and dependent data types (this talk will also explain what all of those mean).\r\n\r\nUsing a library like Ristretto.js, developers can use the dynamic language of their choice, but still benefit from the advantages of a strongly specified type system by using type annotations when needed. Type annotations are directly interoperable with untyped code, such that adopting types in one part of an implementation does not require sweeping changes to the rest of the implementation. Because the approach is implementable entirely within the target language, special supporting infrastructure and pre-compilation steps are not required.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements: This talk builds on the impressive theoretical work of Phil Wadler.

CUnit looked easy when I started writing unit tests but I soon discovered it's limitations and ended up screaming in frustration.  Meanwhile over 18 months the Cyrus IMAP server project has gone from 0 unit tests to 461, of which 277 are written in C with CUnit.  So that's a big itch!\r\n\r\nNovaProva starts with the same basic xUnit paradigm for testing, but extends some concepts in new directions (for example, NovaProva organises tests into trees rather than xUnit's two-level \"suite and test\" approach).

It's a formal goal to have all of our systems under configuration management. Ideally, no system should ever have data that a configuration management engine doesn't know about.\r\n\r\nHow do you draw the line between configuration data and content? If you're maintaining a web server and have a few hundred kb of data in the DocumentRoot it may make sense to store everything in a VCS. If you're maintaining a mrepo/cobbler system, people will notice (and probably complain) if you add 6GB of binary data to a VCS.\r\n\r\nWe all know backups are important. \"Backup all the things\" is a great motto to live by, but often it is the time you spend installing and configuring a server that is lost during a disaster. Not just the data. Configuration management can go a long way in that regard, but it might not be appropriate for everything. If you are maintaining your own RPMs, you don't want to check all your RPMs into your VCS and lug those around with you. There is a concept of \"data\" and there is a concept of \"configuration\". Both of these are very important to all aspects of systems administration, and a VCS might be appropriate for configuration and plain text data, but not necessarily for binary data. Backups might be appropriate for data, but not necessarily for configuration. Where do you draw the line? How do these strategies work together? What if you have nightly backups of your data, but not of your configuration? How much time do you want to spent restoring a backup, just to get your software's configuration back? What if your new guy accidentally inserted a space after the leading slash in his \"sudo rm -rf\" command and wiped out half of your server? Where do you start to get that server back up and running exactly how it was, with both the data and the configuration intact?\r\n\r\nWe will go into depth on the following points using free and open source software:\r\n\r\n- How do you distinguish configuration data from content?\r\n- Where should you keep it?\r\n- How do you implement version control on data that isn't meant for a version control system?\r\n- How do you customize this data for just a few systems?", "Title": "How Mozilla draws the line between configuration and data while using configuration management tools", "URL": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30159/view_talk", "Event": 118, "Start": "2013-02-01 11:35:00", "Presenter_emails": "bhourigan@mozilla.com,jdow@mozilla.com", "Presenters": "Brian Hourigan,Justin Dow", "Duration": "0:45:00", "Id": 163, "Room Name": "MCC5"}, {"Description": "A few years ago, respected kernel hacker Dave Jones gave a highly amusing talk, \"Why userspace sucks\"[1], which looked at the extraordinary ways in which userspace programmers wreck the performance of Linux systems--systems based on the kernel whose performance kernel hackers go to such lengths to improve.\r\n\r\nThere's no denying Dave's analysis.

A majority of mobile devices are using Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) processors but surprisingly single instruction multiple data (SIMD) optimisations for this architecture is not yet common. This is especially true when we consider open source frameworks and libraries running on these newer mobile ARM devices. \r\n\r\nINTEL have recently used their Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (SSE2) framework to improve efficiency of heavyweight functions within the Open Compute Vision (OpenCV) library. Unfortunately, the energy efficiency of INTEL processors means it is not the dominant architecture for mobile devices. Image processing on these devices is now common due to the increasing camera capabilities (where most modern smartphones contain an 8 Megapixel camera). We also see a majority of Android and iOS apps leveraging the OpenCV library to perform image processing. The OpenCV library has numerous computationally intensive operations where the use of SIMD is beneficial, INTEL has identified and remedied these bottlenecks using SSE2, however most mobile devices (which run ARM) will not benefit from it. This is of fundamental importance for a mobile architecture in which efficiency and battery life are the major concern. \r\n\r\nAn alternative to INTEL's SIMD instruction sets (SSE and AVX) are ARM's NEON intrinsic instruction set (released in 2009) and the Ne10 software framework (2012). NEON contains similar, but not identical, vector instructions to SSE and AVX. The Ne10 library provides a set of commonly used vector operations, with each vector operation function consisting of clusters of pre-rolled NEON intrinsics. Ne10 provides a higher level of abstraction, enabling C/C++ floating point arrays to be manipulated at a higher level, allowing for faster development time. But at what cost?\r\n\r\nEnd-users are increasingly using their phones as media processing machines, but what can the app developer do to save the battery life of these devices? Using SIMD to improve computing efficiency which in turn reduced clock cycles is an attractive option!\r\n\r\nDuring this session we will compare between SSE, NEON and Ne10 when considering SIMD optimisations to critical functions of the OpenCV library, we will also discuss speedup factors and ease of use (from a programmers perspective). We will also \"briefly\" examine auto-vectorisation and how different compilers stack-up.

Born in the age of monochrome displays, X's extensibility has allowed it to be dragged kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century.  But this extensibility has come at a cost: the average X server now has at least two wholly unused rendering models, four input stacks, four display management extensions, et al.  Not only that, but the internal design and implementation of the X server (which could generously be described as 'awful') is a serious hinderance to achieving anything.\r\n\r\nOne thing as constant as X's dominance is new rival window systems which aim to replace it.  DirectFB, Berlin/Fresco, QWS, the Y Window System and more, have all aimed at one time or another to unseat X, and failed.  But over the past few years, since the revival of X under the X.Org banner, a great deal of its development has been directed at making it easier for others to replace X.  The ongoing development of DRM/KMS, Mesa/EGL, libpciaccess, libxkbcommon and others, has actually made it practical to build a competing window system for the first time.\r\n\r\nSo where do we stand now? What are the actual benefits and downsides of each? (If you said that X's network transparency is a benefit, please come see this to hear about how that's totally wrong.) Does X's extension model really mean it'll live to see 50? Will Wayland replace X next week?\r\n\r\nThis talk will try to explain the design of both X and Wayland, how they actually operate in practice (which is often totally unrelated to the design), and how they actually differ.  If time allows, there might well be bonus information, speculation and pontification on the future development of each.  This will hopefully be rounded off with the obligatory demo of the true mark of a useful and complete window system: semi-transparent rotated windows.", "Title": "The real story behind Wayland and X", "URL": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30256/view_talk", "Event": 74, "Start": "2013-02-01 13:20:00", "Presenter_emails": "daniel@fooishbar.org", "Presenters": "Daniel Stone", "Duration": "0:45:00", "Id": 167, "Room Name": "MCC3"}, {"Description": "The OpenStack project uses project gating to ensure that the latest\r\ncode in the repository always works.

Zuul is a flexible, general purpose system to integrate\r\nGerrit code review and Jenkins and can be used for project automation\r\npurposes beyond trunk gating.  Driven by a simple, readable YAML file,\r\nZuul has a set of basic concepts that can be combined to make very\r\npowerful automation pipelines.

Some of these solutions require complicated redirections, an overwhelming amount of jargon and lots of verbose XML.

These range from inexpensive to costly, off-the-shelf to custom, common to unique, sane to silly... And also a surprisingly timed request that came in to help those suffering from some extreme disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover design and motivations, along with several criteria that guided the efforts at different times.
