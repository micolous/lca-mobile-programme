      "abstract": "Does Open Source have a sustainable future? One of linux.conf.au\r\n2017\u2019s four keynote speakers, Nadia Eghbal will help you find out!\r\n\r\nlinux.conf.au\u2019s focus in 2017 is The Future of Open Source, so we\u2019re\r\ndelighted to welcome Nadia, a noted researcher on sustainability in\r\nOpen Source.\r\n\r\nNadia's talk examines the inherent tension\r\nbetween keeping code free, and better supporting the people who\r\nmaintain that code. She'll focus on why the future of Open Source requires turning our attention from freedom of the user to freedom of the maintainer.\r\n\r\nOriginally from a venture capital background, in January 2016, Nadia\r\nstarted investigating Open Source as the \u201cdigital infrastructure\u201d upon\r\nwhich the tech industry is built.\r\n\r\nHer initial reports painted a worrying view of the sustainability of\r\nOpen Source software: Many Open Source projects \u2013 ones that form the\r\ndigital infrastructure that many big organisations in tech and\r\ngovernment rely upon \u2013 aren\u2019t in very good shape. Most of Open Source\r\nis not well-funded, and depends heavily on the contribution of free\r\ntime on the part of a small pool of maintainers.\r\n\r\nShe also highlighted that despite building their success on this\r\ninfrastructure, much of the leadership in the tech industry was\r\nlargely unaware of these issues.\r\n\r\nThis research culminated in Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind\r\nOur Digital Infrastructure, a 142-page report published by the Ford\r\nFoundation, that highlights the scale of the problem:\r\n\r\n> Everybody relies on shared code to write software, including\r\nFortune 500 companies, government, major software companies and\r\nstartups. In a world driven by technology, we are putting increased\r\ndemand on those who maintain our digital infrastructure. Yet because\r\nthese communities are not highly visible, the rest of the world has\r\nbeen slow to notice.\r\n\r\n> In the face of unprecedented demand, the costs of not supporting our\r\ndigital infrastructure are numerous. No individual company or\r\norganisation is incentivised to address the public good problem alone.\r\n'''\r\n\r\nMore recently, Nadia has joined GitHub, focusing on finding ways that\r\nGitHub can empower open source maintainers to create and nurture\r\nthriving, healthy open source projects.",

      "abstract": "Where are we going and how do we get there? An optimistic look at our future as a species that shows how our global society is changing, what opportunities lie ahead, and what we need to collectively address if we are to create the kind of life we all want to lead. It will challenge individuals, governments and corporations to critically assess the status quo, to embrace the opportunities of the new world, and to make intelligent choices for a better future.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a fundamental shift of several paradigms that underpinned the foundations of our society, but now hold us back. Like a rusty anchor that provided some stability in high tide, but now binds us to a dangerous reef as the tide goes out. We have seen a shift from central to distributed systems, from scarcity to surplus and from closed to open systems, wherein the latter of each is proving significantly more successful in the modern context. And yet, many of our assumptions, laws and social rules are based on centricity, scarcity and closed as both the default and desired state.\r\n\r\nThere are many people that have talked about technology and the impact it has had on our lives, but technology is only part of the story. The immense philosophical shift over the past 250 years has created a modern perspective that enables all people to be influential, successful and mighty, certainly compared to our peasant ancestors who had very little control over their destinies. People -- normal people -- are more individually powerful than ever in the history of our species and this has enormous consequences for where we are heading and the opportunities ahead. This distribution of power started with the novel idea that individuals might have inalienable rights, and has been realised through the dramatic transformation of the Internet and democratisation of modern technologies.\r\n\r\nHow can we use this power to build a better world? Are we capable of identifying, challenging and ultimately changing the existing ideologies and systems that act to maintain a status quo established in the dark ages? We have come to a fascinating fork in our collective road where we can choose to either maintain a world that relies upon outdated models of scarcity that rely upon inequality, or we can explore new models of surplus and opportunity to see where we go next, together.",

      "abstract": "Privacy isn't dead, but sometimes it's not even clear what we mean when we mean by the word \"privacy\". In this talk we'll take a deep dive into the ways we think about privacy and how technological development has shaped this. In particular, pervasive data collection by government and non-government actors has totally changed the landscape. We live in the future, but we weren't conscious of how we got here.\r\n\r\nOne conception of privacy is about preventing disclosure of personal information. This model - preferred by lawmakers - says that the most important thing is that your name isn't associated with other information without your consent. Of course, this is meaningless when you have anonymized [aggregation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2790010) and [data matching](http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/Statistical+Data+Integration). Why is protection of your name important when your GUID provides a much better matching key, or two data points can be [correlated with high probability](http://www.tapad.com/)? And what does consent mean when you aren't aware of any of this today, let alone how it could affect you in a year or ten?\r\n\r\nAnother version of privacy is about solitude: being able to do things without being observed. A hundred years ago, this meant closing the door. These days there are hidden depths to everything we do. Data collection and analytics is probably being performed by your operating system, your keyboard, the application you're using and every service your data passes through at every OSI layer. Even strong encryption doesn't provide protection from metadata analysis, which can reveal enormous amounts you didn't think you were revealing. Even when this data is anonymised (to the extent that is possible) and used in the aggregate, that still doesn't sit well with many people. And that's before we even get to [creepy inference](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&hp) or [being an unwitting subject of experimentation](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/06/facebook_unethical_experiment_it_made_news_feeds_happier_or_sadder_to_manipulate.html).\r\n\r\nThere is a technological response to this changing environment: open, decentralised systems can be incredibly effective for bringing things back into line with user expectations. But in a world increasingly moving to centralised services, where even your open source tools are running in the cloud, how realistic is it to expect this to catch on? Is a legal approach any better in a globalised world where governments are as much a threat to privacy as non-government actors? Or should society just adapt to this kind of more open living?",

It enables transparency in how testing is done, lets anyone contribute and collaborate, and can signal to users the stability of a project.

We wanted to use the tools of software engineering and reusable research to allow statisticians and epidemiologists to be more efficient - but statisticians and epidemiologists are not computer scientists, and a lot of this world is new to them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we had to develop not only for good software practice, but to ensure that others could use our tools - even when the tool comes with a very different focus from what users are used to.\r\n\r\nUsing the example of batch small area estimation using generalized additive models, I will talk about the project, the tools we used and how to integrate R into a legacy SAS environment with a minimum of pain: allowing for uptake of the strengths of R without exposing new users to its complexity.\r\n\r\nThis case will show how open source scientists and statisticians can benefit from open source, and how open source and openness in general can make science better.",

      "abstract": "It used to be that to set up a serious network, you needed to stock racks and racks with specialized proprietary single-purpose boxes.  This was because only specialized hardware could handle the hundreds of gigabits per second that might flow through any given box.\r\n\r\nThings have changed.  With the rise of cheap commodity Xeon-based servers and widespread availability of 10 gigabit network cards, an off-the-shelf server with a few NICs can now handle the workload.  The age of open source software-driven routers is fully here -- but it doesn't look like what we thought it would, 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nWe thought it would be Linux everywhere, but it turns out that Linux's networking stack is just too slow.  To get around this problem, modern high-speed software switches bypass the kernel entirely, instead booting network cards and handling traffic entirely from user-space.  The up-side of this is that now we have the possibility of using pleasant, hackable, open source, standalone software stacks to deliver network applications that are tailored to specific needs.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents Snabb, a toolkit for building user-space network functions.  Snabb is entirely written in the expressive Lua language, minimizing the amount of code that you have to write to get stuff done.  Snabb specifically uses the LuaJIT implementation of Lua, giving us excellent code generation as well as efficient access to low-level binary data and AVX2 assembly generation.\r\n\r\nSnabb's goal is to be \"rewritable software\": software that's so simple that you could explain it to someone and they could write their own.  By the end of the presentation, you too should have this feeling.\r\n\r\nWe will also describe how Snabb is used in practice in major telecoms and ISPs to provide IPv6 transition technologies to entire countries.  Using Snabb allowed a small team of open-source hackers to ship a product that competed favorably against offerings from traditional network vendors.",

That change made it possible to clean up the CPUFreq core quite substantially and to add more functionality on top of it.  Among other things, a new CPUFreq governor, called schedutil and making decisions based on the CPU utilization information provided by the CPU scheduler, was introduced.  Moreover, the scheduler can pass hints to all of the CPUFreq governors now.  That opened up new possibilities and, for instance, work is in progress to implement energy-aware scheduling (EAS) on top of the schedutil governor.  Apart from that, improvements are being made in the other parts of the CPUFreq subsystem as well, which leads to an optimistic outlook on its future.",

They've done some excellent research, including [publishing some code](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/) that allows anyone to serialize a malicious payload that when deserialized runs the operating system command of their choice, as the user which started the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The vulnerabilities are not with the gadget chains themselves but with the code that deserializes them.\r\n\r\nThere are couple of ways in which this type of attack on the JVM can be mitigated:\r\n\r\n* not deserializing untrusted objects;\r\n* not having the classes used in the 'gadget chain' in the classpath;\r\n* running the JVM as a non-root operating system user, with reduced privileges;\r\n* egress filtering not allowing any outbound traffic other than that matching a connection for which the firewall already has an existing state table entry.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll explore each of these in detail, using JBoss EAP as a example of how these mitigations can be introduced.",

      "abstract": "Ceph is the most popular Software-Defined-Storage technology today, and extremely widespread in the OpenStack world.\r\n\r\nIt enables a multitude of block, object, and file storage use cases, and its flexibility allows it to be configured as required for many different scenarios. The hardware environment can be similarly tailored. This is a sizable decision matrix, but leads to an environment optimally tuned for the required balance between performance, functionality, and cost. Dependability aspects - availability and reliability in particular - are often overlooked.\r\n\r\nBased on twenty years of development and hands-on experience with designing dependable distributed systems and supporting them in production, the goal of this presentation is to make you confident in your choice of Ceph for your use case, and to build an architecture you can trust.\r\n\r\nBeginning with choosing the appropriate access method for your workload, we then continue to introduce the algorithms and technologies in Ceph as they relate to resilience and High-Availability. We will discuss the considerations involved in optimizing a distributed storage system for reliability, availability, and durability of data and fault tolerance. We will look at the performance of Ceph in degraded and recovery scenarios, and how to reduce exposure. This affects the choice of hardware, the approach to feature selection, and system architecture.\r\n\r\nWe will also talk about operational procedures to reduce unplanned downtime, speed-up recovery, and improve supportability.",

      "abstract": "In this talk, I will take you through the tools and techniques\r\nI used to reverse engineer the keyboard controller in my Thinkpad\r\nlaptop and re-flash it with custom firmware.  This will cover how the\r\nThinkpad range of laptops have tried to secure their firmware from\r\nunauthorised changes.  Finally, I will present my ongoing work to\r\nreverse engineer the protocol used between the BIOS and the vendor's\r\nflash update tool (which included writing a custom virtual machine\r\nto emulate a minimal laptop).\r\n\r\nI was driven to start this project when I realised that the laptops\r\ncurrently on sale just did not meet my requirements.  Even the durable\r\nThinkpad laptops I have preferred in the past are being dumbed down.\r\nEventually, I will need a new laptop - and with the current offerings,\r\nI just do not want anything I can purchase off the shelf.  I knew\r\nI was not going to be able to build my own laptop from scratch\r\n(and having discounted all the current free/open laptop offerings)\r\nso I started looking at what I could hack together.\r\n\r\nTo keep the project achievable, I reduced my laptop gripes as far\r\nas I could and focused on just the keyboard - asking the question:\r\n\"Can I shoehorn an older keyboard in a modern laptop?\"  Eventually\r\nanswering it with \"yes, sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nIt turned out to be easily possible to physically replace the\r\nkeyboard on any of the Thinkpads in the xx30 series with one from the\r\nxx20 series.  I was stalled with a half-working keyboard until early\r\n2016 when Zmatt published how he unlocked his laptop.  The firmware\r\nchanges needed were bundled up into a complete build system which\r\nothers have used to replicate the keyboard replacement. However,\r\nwith both these laptop series' being several years old now, I am\r\nstill looking at forward porting this to a newer laptop - which has\r\nled me to research the hardware and firmware design there.\r\n\r\nI will also take the audience through my current knowledge of how\r\nthe vendor's protocol to tell the BIOS to write a new image to\r\nflash works.  Now that it is possible to write new code for the\r\nembedded controller and to install it and run it - I wanted to\r\nknow how secure this was (or wasn't) separate to simply \"fixing\"\r\nthe keyboard.  I have written a custom virtualisation tool to host\r\nthe vendors \"dosflash\" program and capture the protocol it uses to\r\nrequest that the BIOS write a new image to flash.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that others will be inspired to look closer at their\r\nhardware and to give them both some tools and the confidence that\r\nit is possible to \"fix\" the way that consumer hardware works.",

The main reasons behind creating Anchor were:\r\n\r\n- revocation as it exists on the internet today doesn't really work\r\n- certificate expiry / renewal is hard to manage and often forgotten\r\n- existing PKI systems are huge and complicated\r\n- OpenStack deployments needed TLS on every service without depending on big PKI system\r\n- it provides configurable validation/authentication of requests without involving users\r\n\r\nI'll explain how Anchor solves those and other issues.\r\n\r\nAnchor is currently used in HP's Helion OpenStack project and is one of the official OpenStack security projects.

      "abstract": "Learn about practical network protocol analysis techniques, and take control of the devices that surround you!\r\n\r\nOur homes are filled with devices that communicate over both wired and wireless networks, pushing data to each other to make our lives easier.\r\n\r\nMany of these devices started out as simple 2-node pairs: some kind of sensor in one place, and a display in another. The sensor is installed in a useful location and periodically communicates with the display that is sitting on your kitchen counter, and your life is improved somehow. Think of home weather stations, HVAC thermostats, and power usage monitors as common examples.\r\n\r\nThese devices are designed to be cheap, simple, and reliable. What they are NOT designed to be is secure. They commonly blast their data out using transmitters operating in the unlicensed ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) bands without any regard for whether third parties can intercept that data.\r\n\r\nNow stop to think about how many other devices in your house may be using wireless communication. Security cameras, bathroom scales, motion detectors, water tank sensors, car alarms, remote control power strips, flood detection alarms, door locks, electric curtains and blinds, humidity sensors, heart rate sensors. And yes, as Karen Sandler showed us at a previous LCA, even implanted medical devices such as pacemakers!\r\n\r\nThis provides us with both opportunities and threats.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is to make these devices do far more than their maker intended. Many of them were designed to be nothing more than point-to-point systems, but by using some basic tools such as an Arduino we can eavesdrop on their conversations and even imitate them. This talk will demonstrate how to start with an unknown communications method between a pair of devices, and methodically pick it apart until we can see how it works. It will begin with a simple ultrasonic water tank depth sensor that sends a periodic signal to a display in your house, and show how to intercept the signal for your own purposes such as integrating it with a home automation system.\r\n\r\nWhich leads us to the threat. Having analysed the network protocol so that we can read it, we can now also spoof that same protocol to inject false data into the system. With the same skills and tools required to intercept common ISM band signals, we can simply pull up in a car outside a house and cause havoc by manipulating the trivial wireless data packets flying around it.\r\n\r\nFinally, learn which techniques you can use with your own IoT projects to reduce the risk of becoming a victim yourself.",

      "abstract": "Most embedded computing products run Linux.  However, obtaining the complete, corresponding source code (CCS), which Linux's license (the GNU GPL) requires, can prove difficult.  The license dictates certain technical requirements; verification of a source code release for license compliance therefore requires technical analysis.  After years of reviewing many source releases for embedded Linux products, the speaker discovered (finally!) an excellent example of CCS, which not only meets the requirements of the GPL, but also enables and encourages users to take advantage of their rights to modify and install new versions of the software on their device.\r\n\r\nThis talk briefly discusses the components of the router's source release, and then explains the aspects of the source release that made it particularly outstanding.  The talk proposes methods to achieve similar compliance successes on embedded products, suggests procedures for increasing the \"tinkerer\" userbase by improving beyond even what this excellent example provided, and gives insight into and perspective on compliance engineering analysis that occurs during GPL enforcement work.",

This marks a big change for government in its use of open source software, and is supported by a broader set of activities that aim to foster reuse and sharing within government. \r\n\r\nIn this session, I'll give a quick overview of what govCMS is, and how it works. Then talk about how the codebase is managed to suit the needs of government. I'll also cover some of the other activities that are happening around govCMS to encourage its success in the government sector, and how the broader open source / Drupal community may get involved. Note, this will not be a technical presentation - I will talk more about the aims and activities of the govCMS project.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in how governments can run their own open source projects, you should come to this talk.\r\n\r\nNote - I work for Acquia, who are a service provider to the Department of Finance (who manage govCMS). This will not be a sales pitch for Acquia :)",

      "abstract": "Co-presented by an instructor who has done more GPL compliance work (and taught more courses on it) than anyone, and one of the most experienced lawyers in FOSS licensing, this tutorial, teaches the practical details that developers, business managers and lawyers must know to ensure their company's proper compliance with the GNU GPL and related licenses.\r\nThe tutorial first explains the key provisions of GPL for those who wish to redistribute modified versions of GPL software, including handling binaries found in consumer devices.  Thereafter, the tutorial explains in plain and straightforward langauge the most challenging concept in GPL: complete, corresponding source code (CCS), its preparation, and its procurement.\r\n\r\nFinally, the tutorial explains what companies can expect if, despite their best efforts, they fail to comply with GPL, and furthermore outlines the necessary remedies to receive restoration of GPL's permissions.\r\n\r\nBoth the written and spoken portions of this tutorial have been carefully honed and crafted over a decade to yield material that is useful to all three constituencies interested in GPL compliance: developers, business managers, and lawyers.  All three groups will learn important information that relates to their role in the process of effective GPL compliance.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial does not provide rote procedures for compliance; rather, the tutorial focuses on the policy goals that GPL seeks to achieve, and helps developers, lawyers and managers understand how to design processes that both fit their own work-flow and focus on the oft-ignored but most important aspects of the GPL.\r\n\r\nAttendees should already know the very basic concepts of Open Source and Free Software licensing, but the tutorial should be accessible to anyone who has spent at least some time in the Open Source industry.",

      "abstract": "During the past few years, some have argued that we are living in a \"post-open source software\" (\"POSS\") era, characterized by a new generation of developers who work on public software projects without any effort to indicate licensing or any regard to project governance. One view is that this represents an increase in carelessness or legal misunderstanding among developers. However, others have suggested that this behavior may be a deliberate reaction against the \"permission culture\" inherent in traditional approaches to open source. GitHub has been blamed for this phenomenon and it has taken some measures to address it. \r\n\r\nThis talk will explore some legal and policy issues surrounding the tendency (real or supposed) for developers to fail to explicitly license their code. We'll address the following questions:\r\n\r\n* Is there really more \"unlicensed\" code now than there was in the past?\r\n* Is it possible to view such code as implicitly licensed under very permissive terms?\r\n* Are those who complain about unlicensed GitHub repositories merely defending a dying legal and political order?\r\n* How can we reform open source legal culture to improve the situation? What about GitHub's efforts, like choosealicense.com?",

This is the question we set out to answer in this talk. \r\n\r\nPreviously, testing each and every one of the 458,100+ packages came with an enormous infrastructure cost - for each package you need a VM with a full OS, and the associated memory, CPU and disk requirements. This makes exhaustive testing infeasible for most teams. However, we found that by using Docker, we could test the entire Python, Ruby or Node.js ecosystem over a weekend with a single VM.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we look at:\r\n\r\n * how we leveraged Docker to rapidly test the entire Python, Ruby and Node.js package sets on OpenPOWER,\r\n * how the characteristics of containers vs VMs made an otherwise infeasible task both feasible and simple,\r\n * how we evolved this into a continuous-integration process,\r\n * other interesting applications of testing at this scale,\r\n * what we found, and some of the interesting quirks and bugs we encountered and lessons we learned.",

      "abstract": "This paper provides some insight for programmers on way that copyright and patent law in Australia affects free and open source software (FOSS) licences. Without a shadow of doubt the greatest area of legal debate amongst FOSS programmers surrounds the choice of FOSS licence. Many FOSS and Creative Commons style licences are designed to provide developers with a standardised licence which sets the terms for the release and public use of work. Crucially, many of these licences are designed so that developers do not have to seek legal advice for the release of their source code.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the complexity and uncertainty regarding the scope of copyright and patents with respect to software can be discouraging for many FOSS programmers. This confusion and uncertainty may lead to FOSS programmers choosing conflicting licences or choosing to not licence their code at all, which can lead to uncertainty as to who actually owns the software. These issues are important irrespective of whether the software is open source or proprietary, or developed as part of commercial work or on a gratis basis. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, a number of recent decisions in the United States have clarified both the scope of copyright and patent protection for software, fair use under copyright law and the conditions that are enforceable under both proprietary and open source software licences. Given the increasingly internationally standardised nature of patent and copyright law, these decisions are likely to have a considerable impact on the way that law affects software in Australia. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this paper is intended to provide a guide for FOSS programmers on how recent case law has impacted on open source licence enforceability, and the implications of releasing under certain FOSS licences. In particular, this paper provides advice on how open source developers should release their software depending on how they wish their software to be used or distributed. Specifically, this paper will attempt to provide some examples on where particular FOSS licences may or may not be appropriate depending on both the type of software and work licensed and the intent of the developer. Finally, this paper will also provide some tips on steps that FOSS developers or open culture enthusiasts can take to maximise downstream use or sharing of their work.",

This is essential for proper object locality with NUMA and also important to ensure that the kernel can defragment memory properly so that data can be place closely together and to enable to use of huge or giant pages. Over time most Linux systems today require a reboot because performance will suffer as memory becomes more and more fragmented. Servers and devices need to be periodically rebooted. The more complex our kernels become the more different sizes of objects are needed. Growth of complexity results in more opportunities for fragmentation and thus more issues with slowdowns and sluggish behavior.\r\n\r\nThe first implementation on this level was page migration in 2004 which made pages mapped into a user process movable. Then later CMA added the ability to move larger sets of kernel pages that are not on the LRU used for user space pages. This approach may be extended and the hooks used for also making slab objects movable using some callbacks. This could enable much better defragmentation and avoid the need to have to debug Linux systems regularly.",

And just how many bytes of data does the average knitted scarf hold, anyway?\r\n\r\nThese are the questions that motivate Kris as both a knitter and a technologist. As an art form, knitting is inherently binary - just knit and purl. That means you can use sticks and string to encode data in a lot of different ways - like recording the day\u2019s weather, noting enemy troop movements, or even knitting a computer virus. But that\u2019s just the start! Through the act of knitting, the crafter becomes a kind of human CPU, utilising objects and data structures (needles) and free memory (ball of wool) to implement instructions (the pattern). Knitting patterns themselves are very similar to computer languages, with new syntax proposals emerging with innovative constructs and even compilers.\r\n\r\nIf you thought knitting was just an old-fashioned hobby, this talk will open your eyes to the many ways this traditional craft is still relevant in the digital age. (And no, you don\u2019t need to know how to knit!)",

It's like an emulator for a 1980s console that never existed, with integrated development tools for building games in this imaginary environment. The harsh restrictions (by modern standards) such as a 128x128 pixel display, 16 colours and 32kb maximum program size encourage creative approaches, while the use of subset of the Lua programming language makes this a very accessible environment for even beginning coders.\r\n\r\nPICO-8 itself is not open source, but applications made with it all include source - in fact they are distributed as PNGs with the entire cartridge data embedded inside the image! You can stop somebody's game and then switch to the development view to see how they built it. Around this tiny game engine has grown a community of developers who value sharing and learning from each other, and many of them have gone on to release games and tools under open source or creative commons licenses.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show what it's like to work with PICO-8, a few of the cool projects people have built with it, and how it's a great tool for explaining the value of sharing.

It came with a map with a rich story about each of the locations you could visit and characters you could meet along the way.\r\n\r\nNow I wasn't familiar with the setting and wanted to have the information close at hand while we played without having to pause and look up information every few minutes so I decided to turn it into an app.\r\n\r\nI had just started learning Ruby on Rails so naturally it is a Rails App. I then decided on using [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), an open source javascript library for maps, to program the bulk of the functionality.\r\n\r\nThe app let's you create markers on the MouseGuard map with leaflet, link them to the Ruby Database and update any information about the location including pictures and what the players got up to whilst there.\r\n\r\nToday we'll have a look at the app, how it was built, what challenges came up, how I then added in custom leaflet features and eventually got the behaviours I was aiming for.",

      "abstract": "The configuration of Linux hosts has become increasingly declarative, managed by tools like Puppet and Ansible, and by the composition of containers. But if a server is a collection of declarative properties, how do you make sure that changes to that configuration make sense? You can test them, but eventually it's 3 AM and you have an emergency fix that needs to go live immediately.\r\n\r\nData types to the rescue! While data types are usually used to prevent eg, combining an Int and a Bool, they can be used at a much more abstract level, for example to prevent combining a property that needs a Debian system with a property that needs a Red Hat system.\r\n\r\nPropellor leverages Haskell's type system to prove the consistency a host's configuration before deploying it. I'll show how Propellor started with a simple type for its properties, and increasingly refined the types as Propellor was developed, with the goal of catching as many configuration problems as possible, before the configuration gets deployed to the hosts. All the way up to type level detection of port conflicts!\r\n\r\nPropellor doesn't stop at configuring the top level of a host. It can reach inside containers on the host, and configure them using the same properties that can be used at the top level. It can create and manage chroots, docker containers, and systemd machines. A container defined in Propellor can be added to the multiple hosts, or moved between hosts by cutting and pasting a line in the config file. Propellor applies the same type-level checks to the properties of containers as to the properties of hosts.\r\n\r\nGoing further, Propellor can create bootable disk images for a host. This unifies initial installation with ongoing configuration of a host. This is particularly useful for managing the configuration of embedded Linux systems, which are often painful to install interactively.\r\n\r\nThis talk is full of examples of Propellor configuration in Haskell, but no knowledge of Haskell is required.",

It is finding uses for security auditing and enforcement, enhancing networking (including eXpress Data Path), and performance observability and troubleshooting. Many new open source tools that have been written in the past 12 months for performance analysis that use BPF. Tracing superpowers have finally arrived for Linux!\r\n\r\nFor its use with tracing, BPF provides the programmable capabilities to the existing t racing frameworks: kprobes, uprobes, and tracepoints. In particular, BPF allows timestamps to be recorded and compared from custom events, allowing latency to be studied in many new places: kernel and application internals. It also allows data to be efficiently summarized in-kernel, including as histograms. This has allowed dozens of new observability tools to be developed so far, including measuring latency distributions for file system I/O and run queue latency, printing details of storage device I/O and TCP retransmits, investigating blocked stack traces and memory leaks, and a whole lot more. \r\n\r\nThis talk will summarize BPF capabilities and use cases so far, and then focus on its use to enhance Linux tracing, especially with the open source bcc collection. bcc includes BPF versions of old classics, and many new tools, including execsnoop, opensnoop, funcccount, ext4slower, and more (many of which I developed). Perhaps you'd like to develop new tools, or use the existing tools to find performance wins large and small, especially when instrumenting areas that previously had zero visibility. I'll also summarize how we intend to use these new capabilities to enhance systems analysis at Netflix.",

      "abstract": "Power management has been an important part of Linux kernel development for the last several years. Support for many important power management features, such as system suspend and hibernation, CPU idle states management, CPU frequency management, runtime power management of I/O devices and more, has been added to the kernel during that time. However, there still are challenges facing the Linux power management developers.\r\nThe first challenge is that the majority of power management features available in the kernel today were developed in isolation and while they work reasonably well individually, they may not play so well with each other. At the same time, hardware design trends lead to more and more integration and there is a clear need for the Linux power management features to work more closely together too. For this reason, there have been efforts to integrate runtime PM of I/O devices with system suspend and hibernation for some time. There also is work in progress on integrating CPU power management with the CPU scheduler. All of that work will likely continue into the future.\r\nFurther challenges are related to new types of hardware that become available, like persistent memory. Traditional power management features, like system suspend and hibernation, will have to be rethought and modified in response to that and some other changes will likely become necessary in the power management area.\r\nThere also are challenges coming from new display technologies and networking that require relatively high power to be allocated to the transmission of data alone putting the other components of the system under power pressure and causing them to be effectively underutilized. Similar problems appear when system are thermally challenged or when their power supplies are not capable of supporting all of the system components at full capacity at the same time.\r\nAll of this means that the future of power management in Linux will certainly be interesting. We have many interesting problems to solve and quite a lot of work to do, but hopefully power management in Linux will work really well going forward.",

This was done by understanding how a significant amount of latency and consumed resources were the result of gevent\u2019s cooperative multitasking. 3 different open source python profilers, were then used together to identify and fix bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the code base. Most profilers are too slow to use in production, so profiling of web servers often occurs in synthetic environments. But to get an accurate picture of what is happening you need production profiling data, so a production ready Linux signal (SIGVTALRM) based python profiler was used. This talk will cover how Pinterest shrunk their front-end fleet, the techniques and tooling used to improve performance and how they can be applied elsewhere.",

      "abstract": "After I ran out of talent and had a high speed encounter with an immovable object in May 2016, I needed to build a new race car. The car I crashed is\r\nsomewhat unique for many reasons - it's a Locost Clubman. The car has a space frame chassis, based on the original 1957 Lotus 7 designed by Colin Chapman. In the early 1990s, Ron Champion published a Haynes manual titled \"Build your own sports car for as little as \u00a3250\" which was a step by step guide to fabricating and building the entire car. Essentially, it was the source code for the car.\r\n\r\nTo Locost enthusiasts, this is known as the \"book chassis\". It is simple, and very similar to design of the original Lotus 7.  Over the past 20 years, many people have built, broken, analysed and improved on the chassis design. Mechanical engineers have published PhDs using finite element analysis to identify weak points and model stronger chassis designs. There are interweb forums full of people who have built these cars and they share mods, designs, fabrication techniques, etc. In the car world, it's a microcosm of open development and improvement.\r\n\r\nIn analysing the corpse of my car - mostly based on the book chassis - I realised that I needed to make something far stronger. Not just for safety reasons, but also to handle the suspension loads generated by modern race tyres and ludicrous power and torque of my race spec engine. The challenge I face is whether I can design a chassis with open source tools on my laptop and then build it in my workshop.\r\n\r\nAre the open source 3D cad tools capable of building a complex space frame\r\nchassis? Can I get an open source finite element analysis software to perform strength and failure analysis and get sane results? Can I design all the parts I need and send them to 3rd parties to get them laser cut, bent, fabricated and delivered to my door? Can I integrate my little CNC milling machine into these tools (i.e. CAM) so I can rapidly fabricate prototypes and iterate designs? If the open source tools exist, is it even possible to make them work together in a sane way? What tools have I had to write myself? What landmines will I step on?\r\n\r\nI really don't know - by the time January and LCA rolls around I might have a car built, or I might have a pile of scrap metal and broken, twisted dreams. All I know is that I'm going on an adventure in open source land and I will have fun finding out where it takes me. Maybe you will, too.",

In this talk, I'll draw from more than a decade of experience working with open source communities (and a few months of experience keeping Gordon alive) to explain how caring for a Venus Fly Trap is much like caring for a community. Like carnivorous plants, communities can't be left alone to fend for themselves, and they won't explicitly tell you when there is a problem. Communities and carnivorous plants need an energy source, healthy environments, pest control, and occasional maintenance. Whether you're a seasoned community gardener, or just starting to develop your carnivorous plant green thumb, you'll learn practical tips for nurturing healthy roots that grow thriving communities (... or Venus Fly Traps).",

It turns out that we in the Open Source community can no longer shake a disapproving finger at the closed-source giants without also pointing to ourselves and asking what we can do better. In this era of increasingly modular code development and reuse of common libraries, we need to be considering the impact of potential flaws in code we assume to be secure due simply to its widespread use and Open Source nature.  So, what do we do?  Although it\u2019s not a magical solution or panacea to the problem; implementing Security Development Lifecycle best practices and principles for each and every software development endeavor we undertake (whether it is for your job or for an Open Source Project) can go a long way to reducing the potential for common security flaws.  In addition, there is no reason that Static Code Analysis should not be part of every development effort.  We are still seeing obvious, easy to fix flaws in modern source code. Input sanitization issues, Cross-Site-Scripting, buffer overflows, and many other known issues still represent the bulk of security issues present. Static Code Analysis can help catch many of these unnoticed issues before code makes it out of the developer\u2019s hands. In addition, we can perform our own analysis on libraries that we wish to leverage to help determine risk ourselves.  In this talk, we will explore some common best practice Security Development Lifecycle theory and how we can integrate this into modern code development schemes.  We will also look at how to integrate Static Code analysis tools into the development process, to include a demo.",

Most\r\nweb browsers use the open source libjpeg-turbo for decoding JPEG files because\r\na) it is libre software and b) there has been significant investment in SIMD\r\noptimization.  However, in applications where the resulting image is immediately\r\nuploaded to the GPU for compositing (like in modern web browsers) this approach\r\nhas two drawbacks:\r\n\r\n  1. The full uncompressed image must be uploaded to the GPU\r\n  2. Time spent decoding on the CPU robs computation from other tasks\r\n\r\nThese issues are exacerbated as more content is provided in high definition.\r\n\r\nThe jpeg_gpu project aims to solve both these problems by shifting the decode\r\ncomputation as early as possible to the GPU.  Partially decoded JPEG data is\r\nuploaded as soon as the entropy coded symbols are read, and a set of pre-defined\r\nshaders complete the rest of the decode into a GPU texture.  Depending on the\r\nresolution of the image and how much it is compressed, the speed-up can be\r\nsignificant.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover how the jpeg_gpu library is designed to take maximum\r\nadvantage of GPU parallelism.  I will include a brief discussion of some\r\ntrade-offs made when designing the shader routines based on experimentation.\r\nThe real world performance of this approach will be discussed based on the\r\nintegration of jpeg_gpu into the WebRenderer compositing engine in Servo.",

Disagreements seem inevitable, but what if they could be handled rationally, in a way that left everyone feeling at least OK about the outcome? It's possible. You can learn to cut to the heart of the disagreement, mediate and move forward.\r\n\r\nMany of us avoid dealing with tricky situations or let conflict avoidance keep us from accomplishing amazing things together. Conflict can be handled -- without flamethrowers -- and the process will often make your community stronger. It just takes time, a slightly relaxed ego and a willingness to see the best outcome for the most people. This talk covers when to handle conflict, strategies for both one-on-one situations and group situations and tips on how to scale your conflict resolution skills, like a boss.",

Some sites have moved to using expensive solid state drives (SSDs) for storage, but there has to be a better way we can solve this in software, right?\r\n\r\nThis presentation continues our Swift sharding adventure from where we left it last year - but now addressing a new set of challenges we've come across in our proof of concept container sharding implementation. During testing of even larger data sets we've come across a number of limitations of the underlying SQLite database, meaning we've had to develop work arounds so that we are able to shard even larger containers. Come and see how we performed large scale testing, how we narrowed down where the limitations were, how we developed our solutions to these problems, all the while trying to maintain backwards comparability.",

Trailing information in our wake every time we touch the Internet, it becomes increasingly possible to create a digital presence that will use these (and future) data points to respond and react to events after our deaths much as we might have in life.\r\n\r\nBut, as we grow ever-closer to building this reality, how should we think about our ghosts? Are they technically 'us'? Do we own them, or does Google? Could a hacker spin up a doppelganger to plague you in life? Could a corporation do the same?\r\n\r\nTo explore the answers to these questions and more, light some candles, and follow Lilly into the beyond.",

The talk will be fun, but the lessons are practical for developers--and people who work with them--of all experience levels.",

However there is an issue, it is too difficult for humans to deal with all the data being generated or analyze all the results from the testing. To deal with this the OpenStack community has developed and deployed several tools to help deal with the torrent of data. Using and building off these tools have been invaluable especially as the OpenStack project continues to grow. This talk will explain the basics of OpenStack's CI infra and cover the approach and tooling used by the OpenStack community to interact with the large amount of test result. It will explain the techniques used and the benefits derived from having both open test result data and performing analysis on that data to understand the project.",

You put on your 1986 mirror-finish Aviators and walk out of the building just as it explodes in a fireball of best practices.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s learn about:\r\n* How pickpockets do their thing\r\n* Why you don't even need to know pickpocketing and the previous dot point was a waste of your time\r\n* Stealing stuff in plain sight (for example, keys off a table)\r\n* Distracting someone juuuuust right so they leave their computer unlocked\r\n* Manipulating attention, disguising, misleading, implying, and generally being a sneaky person\r\n* Pretending we know psychology to explain how this all works\r\n* How to palm fifteen basketballs\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll really be skating on the line of breaking the magician\u2019s code here so buckle up and remember to bring your wallets in your left pockets.",
