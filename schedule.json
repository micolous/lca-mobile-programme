To make technology work for people, we need to take this power back \u2013 and demand that the development of technology involve social, political and ethical considerations. Protecting encryption is about protecting democracy \u2013 it is about shifting power away from states and companies and towards people. \r\n\r\nIn late 2018, digital rights activists took on the national security establishment to try to resist attacks on encryption. It was a important and spirited effort but it was ultimately unsuccessful. The AABill passed, despite it being widely-accepted as a serious threat to our digital security. This talk will explain how that occurred, and how the intersection of technology and politics can be a challenging place for people interested in good public policy. \r\n\r\nIf we are going to improve our laws and public policy in relation to technology, we are going to need to fight for it. This requires a broad based alliance. We must take highly technical debates to the mainstream. It means finding ways to discuss these issues with precision but also simplicity, with determination but also compassion. The opportunities are there provided we can organise and make the most of them.",

In general, this expertise is viewed as a good thing.\r\n\r\nBut what if there is an issue with expertise? Is expertise always a good thing?\r\n\r\nThis presentation will discuss how expertise has limitations when it is applied outside its normal area of application, and how these limitations will typically not be evident to the individual applying the expertise. Further, even in situations where evidence suggests the application of the expertise is inappropriate, it is likely that an individual will continue to apply their expertise regardless of its inappropriateness.\r\n\r\nTo explore these issues the presentation will examine the behaviour of a group of firefighters fighting a wildfire in Mann Gulch in the US in 1949, it will look at psychological studies that examine the concept of Priming, and it will discuss how the game of baseball can assist in unravelling why expertise can sometimes let us down.",

      "abstract": "Tiny embedded computers, like the original Arduino, are great for\r\nautomating simple tasks. What they are not great at is providing an\r\neasy-to-learn environment for new programmers.\r\n\r\nAs a part of a middle school robotics course based on Lego, I've\r\ndeveloped a new language, Snek, which runs on these machines. Snek can\r\nrun in as little as 32kB of ROM and 2kB of RAM. It provides a simpler,\r\nsafer, easier to explore environment than C++. Snek is a subset of the\r\nPython language and comes with a host-based IDE written in Python that\r\nruns on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will describe the Snek language along with a few of\r\nthe interesting implementation details including:\r\n\r\n * A new parser generator, lola, that generates\r\n   a parser 1/10 the size of bison\r\n\r\n * An in-place compacting garbage collector\r\n\r\n * A fine hack for representing values in 32 bits that includes 32-bit\r\n   floats\r\n\r\n * Some challenges with Python syntax and\r\n   semantics which make it difficult to fit into a small\r\n   environment.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a demonstration of a few Snek-based Lego robots\r\nalong with a description of how Snek has been integrated into the\r\nclassroom environment. Comparisons with other embedded Python\r\nimplementations will also be provided, including Micro Python, Circuit\r\nPython and full Python running on systems like the Raspberry PI.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn something about how interpreted Python\r\nimplementations operate, how Python can be used in embedded systems\r\nand what teaching programming to middle school students (10-14 years\r\nold) is like.",

You look around and see that everyone but the presenter appears to be mentally grasping for some key understanding what's being said. Your carefully gathered notes say \"SDL PRS review SS2 Smokey Lagoon PKR BKM\". Somehow, the jargon you've relied on for precise and detailed technical communication as devolved into incomprehensible gibberish.\r\n\r\nCasey Schaufler, who's been working in operating systems development for the past 40 years, explains the reasons technical documents and presentations so often become impossible to decipher.  There's much more to it than the unguarded and unexplained use of acronyms, abbreviations and code words. The impact of language background on the use of technical terms is explored. How cultural differences between individuals and organizations can interfere with technical communications, and how that differs from general communication is discussed. What can go wrong when technical documentation is mistranslated into plain language, resulting in words with completely different meaning also gets much deserved attention. Casey will provide examples, some humorous, some maddening and some otherwise which demonstrate the problems we face. In the end, hopefully useful and pragmatic approaches for avoiding the worst gibberish production are presented.",

      "abstract": "Programmers are used to their compilers catching tiny problems in their code. When you're a writer, it's harder to catch these problems. Wouldn't it be nice if you could run an error-checker on your dialogue?\r\n\r\nThis talk discusses the application of compiler optimisation and correctness checking techniques to branching narratives, which allow authors to verify the logic of their narrative independently of running it in the game.\r\n\r\nYarn Spinner is an open source narrative design tool used in many games, including Night in the Woods (Infinite Fall / Finji) and OK KO: Let\u2019s Play Heroes (Capybara Games / Cartoon Network), that allows both writers and narrative designers to write, edit, script and manage their game's dialog using a simple scripting language that's reminiscent of Twine. While most games devise their dialog in script form, it's typically implemented using another system, such as a spreadsheet, or node-based tools. By contrast, Yarn Spinner implements a domain-specific language designed to be easy for a non-programmer to write their dialogue in, and easy for a programmer to implement gameplay-specific behaviour.\r\n\r\nCompilers for most programming languages are designed to catch common mistakes, and give warnings where appropriate. In recent years, tools for static analysis of programs - a technique where a compiler analyses the behaviour of code without running it - have allowed programmers to detect subtle bugs that a simpler compiler could not. For example, it's possible to identify a combination of branches that lead to an uninitialised variable being returned from a function.\r\n\r\nBecause Yarn Spinner is a complete programming language, we are able to apply the same techniques from compiler design to assist writers. For example, a compiler is able to analyse a branching narrative tree, take into account the variables that are checked to decide what options are available, and determine that a line of dialog can never be reached.\r\n\r\nThese techniques allow for more reliable testing of dialogue. Testing a branching piece of dialogue often relies on the tester repeating a number of decisions in order to set up the necessary state, which can be repetitive and tedious. However, a static analyser is able to identify what the values of certain variables _must be_ in order for a line to be accessed, which allows the tester to jump straight to the lines under test, skipping large amounts of per-test setup time. This allows someone who\u2019s trying to test out a conversation to do it in realistic conditions, skipping past the repetition while also guaranteeing that the state of the dialogue is the same as if they\u2019d performed it manually.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll discuss work on Yarn Spinner that implements symbolic execution and basic block analysis, which allows writers to easily spot problems in the implementation of their narrative, saving development and testing time, and avoiding wasted production resources.\r\n\r\nCome and learn how to get started with these techniques, and how to use them in Yarn Spinner, the open source narrative design tool!",

They can then provide a signed quote of this log in order to prove to a remote site that they booted the expected software. In the early 2000s we were concerned about that resulting in websites that would refuse to grant you access unless you were running an unmodified proprietary operating system, but for various reasons that turned out to not be a problem in the real world. Some years later, how can we use this attestation data for the power of good?\r\n\r\nThis presentation will describe the functionality of TPMs and how the event log is generated, and describe techniques for making use of TPMs to protect access to network resources, solve the problem of trusting SSH host keys in enterprise environments and make it easier for people to recover their systems while on the road. It will include demonstrations of using newly released open source software to build novel attestation solutions for protecting end users without giving up privacy or control.",

SSH certificates expire (this is good), and can also tell SSH what you can or can't do with your session. The can even help mint a new user on a brand new trusting host. And if you need to use sudo, don't worry your certificate's got your back too.\r\n\r\nHow do you get short lived SSH certificates from a self service certificate authority? Grab your identity on the cli using some nifty OAuth2 in your browser, swap this identity to get temporary AWS credentials, invoke a lambda function, sign a public key, and you're on your merry way.\r\n\r\nOpen source tools are all over this problem.

      "abstract": "As digital collections continue to grow, the appetite to use them in different ways is also growing. However, the speed with which this growth is happening is also leaving some of us behind. There is a skills gap in GLAM and the researchers most likely to make use of these digital collections. At AARNet we are working with our GLAM and HASS colleagues to bridge this gap with training sessions and freely available learning materials made with them in mind. Working with the Carpentries model of teaching foundational computing skills to researchers, we are creating resources that we hope will encourage those with low (or no) computing or data science skills to take the first step. Working alongside Tinker (the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences Data Enhanced Virtual Laboratory) we are encouraging new users, such as librarians, to learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks. In this paper I will introduce SWAN, the new environment for Jupyter Notebooks, and the range of training resources and methods being used to help uplift the community's digital dexterity, encouraging curiosity and confidence along the way.",

      "abstract": "Consider these two cases: Volkswagen was caught out having written software code that allowed their cars to cheat emissions tests. Uber also developed software (called 'greyball') which allowed them to cheat law enforcement officials trying to crack down on ride-sharing. The difference between them is that Volkswagen software engineers went to jail, and Uber software engineers didn't. Why? Because one is a car company, and one is a software company.\r\n\r\nMost industries have had what we might call an \"oh no\" moment. It's those moments that encourage industries to become better regulated, in order to prevent further disasters. The IT industry has had many moments that could be considered consequential enough to encourage better regulation, but the changes have never been made. Because the industry has avoided effective regulation for so long, it is possible that we are hurtling towards a disaster of epic proportions, one that we haven't even managed to conceive of yet.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will go through some historical examples of disasters leading to regulation in other industries, and the measures that were put into place to mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the major moments from the IT industry that should have prompted regulation, and haven't. Finally, I will discuss ways that IT professionals can blow the whistle on potential disasters before they happen ... without losing your job!",

As an introduction to pen-testing, this is designed for novices who are interested in the Cyber Kill Chain, how to test common systems and those wanting to know how to get started, rather than just watching videos. As such this is not intended for advanced users.\r\n\r\nMany people use tools and systems like Kali to run penetration tests without really knowing what we are doing. This tutorial will introduce a few tools and will have a vulnerable server or two for you to launch your attacks against ensuring this is a closer to real-life attack, rather than just theoretical.\r\n\r\nUsers will need a version of Kali Linux installed or the ability to quickly copy a virtual machine (VirtualBox is the suggested software for this). Short guidance at the beginning will be provided for this but users will need the VirtualBox software installed.\r\n\r\nWe will start by finding the device, then testing for vulnerabilities and attempting to gain access.\r\nA step-by-step guide will ensure that all people get some action and hopefully a greater understanding of the mindset and complexity of what it means to \"hack\" in to something. \r\n\r\nParticipant will need to bring their own laptop with the following minimum recommended specs:\r\n4GB RAM - 2 will be used by the VM, 20GB HDD space, at least 4 processors, wireless network card, VirtualBox or similar ( VMWare or KVM/QCOW etc). Only VirtualBox will be supported and I allow 10 minutes at most for setup.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will be run by one of the writers of the TAFE NSW Cybersecurity course and a tutor for Cybersecurity at SCU on the Gold Coast.",

If you need high-availability and a resilient and stable system to process your data this is the tutorial for you. \r\n\r\nBased on the experience obtained in the past 4 years at the University of Oslo processing billions of logs a day from more than 15000 devices, this tutorial will give some inside information and many tips about how to achieve this with Linux and open source software.\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to put together HAProxy, agents, Logstash, Elasticsearch and RabbitMQ to work at scale. You will also hear about the problems and pitfalls we have experienced during these years and what we learned from them.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial format is a lecture with time for questions and short discussions as we move along.

An unprecedented number of hardware designs were proposed by both academic researchers and industry professionals in a very short period that has taken the world by storm. However, the RISC-V software ecosystem also needs to grow even at a faster rate if RISC-V can be a truly competitive alternative to mainstream ISAs. The open source software ecosystem in RISC-V will eventually determine the success of the RISC-V platform. This talk will give an insight into the RISC-V software ecosystem evolution over the last few years and the current status of major software projects. It will also include future goals and some of the software projects that require more love from the community. We hope this talk will serve as a good starting guide for new/existing developers to start contributing to the RISC-V software ecosystem. A bigger developer community will facilitate RISC-V ecosystem growth even more and drive the ultimate success of the RISC-V revolution.",

      "abstract": "The RISC-V ISA provides PC-relative addressing, which means that with hardware equipped with an MMU that supports virtual memory addressing the ELF PIC psABI is straightforward and does not require the use of a dedicated GOT or global data pointer (GP) register in code intended for PIE executables or DSOs, because all static addresses can be worked out from the PC with the aid of a couple instructions.  This is in particular because at load time virtual addresses of all loadable segments in an ELF PIC image are relocated by adding the same value (the base address in ELF-speak) to all of them, according to how the image has been mapped in virtual memory, which is the difference between the virtual addresses recorded in the file loaded and the corresponding actual addresses in memory, which in turn implies that the distance between the text segment and any other segment remains fixed.\r\n\r\nThis approach does not work for NOMMU systems if we want to keep read-only text/rodata segments shared among processes, because there is no virtual addressing available to remap physical addresses such that for all the processes involved the text and other read-only segments occupy the same addresses while the corresponding read/write data segments are within a fixed distance from the text segment and do not clash with read/write data segments of another process both at a time.\r\n\r\nThe problem can be solved, however it requires that read-only text/rodata segments and read/write data segments are mapped in memory independently of each other, and that in turn precludes the use of PC-relative addressing to reach data.  Instead a register has to be set aside to hold the GP, unique to each of all the ELF images/modules (both the main executable and all the DSOs) loaded.  This in turn not only requires extending the RISC-V psABI with GP-relative addressing, but defining a new convention for making function calls, such that if a call reaches into another ELF module the value of the GP is updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis is handled by creating a data structure, called a function descriptor (the first letters of which contribute to the FD letters in the FDPIC acronym), that associates a value of the GP with each external (preemptible) function symbol.  The function descriptor is then used in the code sequence used to make a function call modified such as to load both the GP and the PC with the addresses intended.  The use of a GP register, the modified function calling convention, and the new data structures and definitions all comprise the FDPIC psABI.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I am going to discuss a proposed design for the FDPIC psABI for RISC-V systems, and the changes required for the toolchain and the runtime to support it with the Linux/GNU system.",

      "abstract": "RISC-V has many attractions, ranging from the openness of the architecture, its clean-slate design based on simplicity and scalability, as well as the RISC-V Foundation's strong commitment to security from the ground up.\r\n\r\nAs such, RISC-V is an extremely attractive platform for the open-source seL4 microkernel with its unrivalled verification and security story. This has led industry players, especially Germany-based HENSOLDT Cyber, making a major bet on the combination of RISC-V and seL4, resulting in them funding the formal verification (implementation correctness proof) of seL4 on RISC-V.\r\n\r\nI will discuss our experience with implementing and verifying seL4 on the RISC-V architecture, and related open-source technologies we are employing to allow us to build secure systems. This includes the CAmkES component framework that supports a security-by-architecture approach, and the Cogent systems language that is designed to reduce the cost of verified system components such as file systems and device drivers. \r\n\r\nOne interesting aspect are timing channels. We have been working for a number of years on *time protection*, the temporal equivalent of memory protection, as a systematic timing-channel prevention. Our experience on x86 and ARM processors is that they lack the mechanisms to do this completely. RISC-V presents an opportunity to get this right, and I will report on my experience working with the RISC-V Foundation's Security Standing Committee to get the required mechanisms into the processor specification.",

You know the one. The one where you can `git push` with a couple of config files and your full stack magically rolls out like a red carpet at the oscars. No more staying up until 2am apt-get installing, and breaking your brain on nginx configs. It is just so deliciously easy, with just one teensy little catch. You don't own the server. It is deployed into a locked down proprietary fortress where any old Bezos can gaze like the beady Eye of Sauron upon your users' data. Whats more the deployment process is completely opaque. You don't have access to any of the source. Horrifying!\r\n\r\nWell I'm here with a glorious Free Software salve. After leaving the dark side of the PaaS which we shan't mention, I was lucky enough to find Piku. It was a dream. No Kubernetes clusters or Docker swarms needed here. Just a thousand lines of Python and some shell scripts. You can grok the source in one night. Point the bootstrap script at a fresh VPS (or Raspberry Pi!) and a couple of minutes later you have your own multi-tenant app server for less than the price of a single one of those dance-with-the-devil PaaS accounts. Configure a git remote, write a couple of lines in your Procfile, `git push` and you're away! Your app unfolds upon your own server like an origami space station solar panel in all its shining glory. Dependencies installed, SSL cert obtained, Nginx configured, all done for you.\r\n\r\nThis talk will go in depth into the history, minimalist philosophy, and usage of Piku. By the end of it you will be able to do zero-fiddling `git push` deploys to your own servers.",

This RFC wasn't a request for a technical standard, it was a statement on their concerns about Governments trying to restrict or interfere with cryptography. They felt that there was a need to offer \"All Internet Users an adequate degree of privacy\"\r\n\r\nSince that time successive governments around the world have sought to build back doors into encrypted apps and services to access more citizen and visitor data.  As of July 2019, the AG of the United States William Barr stated: \u201cSome argue that, to achieve at best a slight incremental improvement in security, it is worth imposing a massive cost on society in the form of degraded safety,\u201d i.e For security Americans should accept weakened encryption.  The head of the FBI also claimed that weakened encryption wouldn't break it.  \r\n\r\nIn Australia the metadata retention laws have been abused against journalists with 58 searches carried out by the AFP.  In 2015 ACT police carried out 115 metadata searches.  UK officials have a cavalier attitude to the EU SIS database which tracks undocumented migrants, missing people, stolen cars, or suspected criminals.  \r\n\r\nIETF Session 105 mentioned privacy and concerns with the mass collection of data. While the IAB and IESG were worried about US export controls on cryptography there is an argument for RFC 1984 to be updated to include the unnecessary mass collection of data and to use it as a term for IT professionals, privacy advocates and the public to rally behind. \r\n\r\nIn this talk let's recount a brief history of governments around the world wanting to weaken encryption as RFC 1984 warned us about.  \r\n\r\nWe live in a time where citizens put data into commercial, healthcare and Government systems to access services, some services are only accessible online. From CCTV to Facebook people have little understanding of why mass collection of data is dangerous. There is little scrutiny of who can access that data, from Scotland to the US. \r\n\r\nOpen Surveillance is only a small part of the picture when profiling citizens.  It still counts as personal data, when combined with metadata and the actual data that people put into social media and services like ancestor DNA test kits.  Businesses who use CCTV have to put up signs to warn the public they are recording.  So called anonymized data still contains identifiers that can tie to individuals.  \r\n\r\nLet's talk about Ovid and peacocks. Let's explore how to expand the RFC to cover recent developments in surveillance capitalism with governments accessing that data, but not securing it. We need to make it clear weakened encryption, the mass collection and careless retention of data isn't acceptable. We need to update and implement RFC 1984.",

A missing piece of this is ensuring the firmware is the image you expect it to be running, weather that is something your vendor shipped, an update, or something you build yourself from the open source project.\r\n\r\nThe next generation of BMC hardware will allow a hardware root of trust to secure the entire boot chain. Come hear about how that works, and how the design goes to great lengths to ensure user freedoms to replace firmware while still being secure are preserved. This talk will coverTPMs, EEPROMs,  keys, and signing, from a firmware perspective.",

      "abstract": "Just as with classical computers we need tools to convert the programs we write into something that can actually be run on computers. For classical computers this normally involves converting a higher level language into machine code, but with quantum computing the programs are written at a much lower level, the equivalent of assembly code. However, because of limitations with the current quantum computers available today even programs written at this low a level have to be adapted and optimized for each specific backend to be able to run successfully. Making this compilation processes effective and efficient directly impacts how a program will perform, and whether you're able to get a meaningful result or not.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explain what is involved in compiling software to run on a quantum computer and why it is necessary. It will cover how it works, different optimization techniques that are available, and how it can effect the results from running your program. It will also cover how you can customize the compiler optimizations used to try and better optimize your program to get better results, and how a bad compiler output can result in getting a noisy result, or even lead to you getting no meaningful result at all.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important characteristics of any operating system is the ability to safely store and retrieve end user data.  However, this area can be one of the most difficult things to test completely.  Hardware manufacturers strive to make their hardware as reliable as possible, so testing error paths for uncommon conditions is problematic.  For developers having a simple easy to use way to create these types of errors is vital for ensuring correctness.  Developers have tools like scsi_debug, dm-flakey, and others to exercise these error paths, but they all have limitations.\r\n\r\nVirtual machines are ubiquitous, but people may not think of using them for purposely and deliberately creating errors for testing.  We have a opportunity to provide a test environment that allows easy testing of these infrequent error paths.  To force the kernel down read error paths, write error paths, silent data corruption detection/correction, timeouts, etc., during all times of kernel operation and even before the kernel gets loaded by the boot loader.  It's the only way to present an error that is just like actual hardware.\r\n\r\nAttend this talk to learn about:\r\n* Importance of testing the storage stack\r\n* Difficulties in testing\r\n* Different approaches in generating storage errors\r\n* Benefits of adding testing capabilities to virtual machine vs. other approaches\r\n* Other possibilities (block histograms, access patterns, playback)\r\n* A preview proof of concept written for scsi-disk device in QEMU\r\n  https://github.com/tasleson/qemu/tree/block_error_inject",

While methods are relevant to many technology contexts, confusion remains around what these methods are, what the threat model of potential real-world implementations could be, and why those hardware abstractions are included in modern processors in the first place. The existing mitigations for commercial components are implemented in software. This presentation examines what these software mitigations look like and what they do.",

The sector itself has become interested in the possibilities of openness - both in the software and the data, and champion the F.A.I.R. principles, which can safeguard humanity's heritage for future generations. Whilst the technological possibilities provide heady visions of future science-fiction-like scenarios where people immerse themselves in wholistic experiences, drenching their senses in vivid augmented realities; there is a concomitant growing awareness of the ethical constraints which must be managed.  Terms such as data sovereignty, data colonialism, cultural appropriation etc. reflect recognised risks and awareness of the interplay between our technological solutions and potential concerns, particularly amongst the indigenous custodians of culture, can assist in cementing strong, long-term relationships between all parties as we walk together into this exciting future.\r\nThis presentation aims to provide an overview of ethical considerations for data management in the GLAM sector, with a view to promoting constructive debate on strategies for integrating ethics into technological solutions. Awareness of these issues can also assist each of us, as individuals, to deconstruct aspects of the potential for appropriation of our own lives and to question where humanity as a whole is heading. The heritage of humanity is a concern for all of us and we each contribute to our joint legacy in ways we might not yet realise. By working together we can promote a positive future for humanity as a whole.",

In fact, Don just last year wrote that the technology industry badly needs to re-focus on the true meaning of Human Centered Design, observing that despite his decades of advocacy, the same kinds of design flaws continually recur.\r\n\r\nWe are just a handful of years short of the centenary of the publication of Modern Architecture pioneer Le Corbusier's maxim \"A house is a machine to live in\", yet our architecture remains stubbornly steam powered.\r\n\r\nMy position is that we ought step back and critically reexamine the shape and detail of our workplaces and homes. The great labour saving devices of the 20th century freed us from much physical drudgery, but significant cognitive burden remains. I will examine, in the abstract and concrete, how much cognitive load is imposed on us by our environment. It has been written that a modern human makes 30,000 choices every day.\r\n\r\nFor example, why are our light switches placed for the convenience of builders, not inhabitants. Why do so many of our labour-saving appliances require us to spend so much time monitoring and pampering them. How often do you stumble about in the dark fumbling for a light switch. Wouldn't you prefer to discover the failed refrigerator or flooded storeroom before the contents are ruined?\r\n\r\nJoin me for an imagination of how Living In The Future could truly be better.",

      "abstract": "Back in 2013 we started development of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on top of one of the widespread HTTP accelerators. That time we realized that modern HTTP accelerators were designed to service normal HTTP requests and don't suite well for filtering massive HTTP traffic from malicious clients such as DDoS bots. A WAF protecting huge web resources or thousands of small web sites also experiences overloading due to deep analyzing of HTTP and web content.\r\n\r\nSo we started to develop our own hybrid of HTTP accelerator and a firewall, Tempesta FW, to address the problem of servicing and filtering massive HTTPS traffic. It can be used as standalone web acceleration and protection system as well as a WAF accelerator performing pre-filtering for more advanced WAF. Tempesta FW is an open source Linux kernel module integrated into the Linux TCP/IP stack and implementing rich set of HTTP security features.\r\n\r\nTempesta FW implements HTTPtables, HTTP requests filtering tool which can be used together with nftables to define filtering rules on all network layers on the same time. Strict and flexible HTTP fields verification, HTTP cookies and JavaScript challenges, as well as various rate limits, are also implemented to efficiently block HTTP(S) DDoS and Web attacks.\r\n\r\nThis talk describes common issues with filtering malicious HTTPS traffic on modern HTTP accelerators, how Tempesta FW solves them, and several low-level topics such as  SIMD HTTP strings processing algorithms, but mostly I'll concentrate on TempestaTLS - a fork of mbedTLS to implement TLS handshakes in the Linux kernel. TempestaTLS cooperates with the TCP/IP stack to send records of optimal size and avoid copying. The handshakes state machine is carefully optimized to provide highest performance. I'll show performance benchmarks comparing TempestaTLS with OpenSSL in workloads close to real life DDoS attack against TLS handshakes.",

And yet, despite the availability of technically sound and fully functional projects, widespread adoption is nowhere near.\r\n\r\nDrawing on his experience from working with digital identity startups, Matrix, Scuttlebutt, microblogging protocols (GNU social, Mastodon), and various blockchain projects, Martin takes a shot at identifying the reasons why the uptake is so slow.

      "abstract": "ROS, the \"Robot Operating System\" is more accurately described as a framework of open source software that runs on Linux and helps you build robots by combining larger \"nodes\" of code. ROS helps these nodes communicate and can handle (re)starting them, monitoring them, and stopping them for you. With ROS you can use existing code to convert a depth sensing camera into fake laser scan data. Then you can insert your own code to update a map showing where obstacles are located. This way you can focus on the parts of the robot that are the most interesting to you at the time and draw on a large base of existing code to enable your robot to perform complicated tasks without having to write everything. Better yet you can drop parts of the code in and out of the robot to compare how well an idea works against an existing implementation.\r\n\r\nI will talk about ROS and about some of the robots I have built using it. There are many lessons along the way, some of which are only learnt the hard way it seems. It is always fun when your robot doesn't notice it is heading toward a wall and you pick it up off the ground only to have it stop moving and think it is magically \"outside the room\" on it's internal map. The books don't seem to cover the magical ghost_robot_mode=off option.\r\n\r\nInitially I attempted to run a low degree of freedom arm using MoveIt which is the ROS arm control software. I ended up writing that code manually and found that you need at least a 6 degree of freedom (dof) arm to succeed using MoveIt. While some cheap arm kits are sold as 6 dof they aren't and you will need some tinkering to make them real before MoveIt will yield acceptable results https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx0TrbOsok\r\n\r\nI hope that some of the stories of long battles will inspire interest in using ROS and playing with robotics. I will have a few of my builds on hand including the outdoors \"houndbot\" with discussions about physical builds.\r\nhttp://monkeyiq.blogspot.com/2018/04/my-little-robotic-pals.html",

But things are not that simple at 100G anymore due to restrictions on performance of the disk subsystems and the Linux operating system overhead. And why would one want to capture 100G traffic? One reason is that most of the fiber optic wide area links are being converted from 10Gbps to 100Gbps circuits and another is that it is mandatory to capture all traffic going through links in some industries due to government regulation (well governments may want to capture traffic too for other reasons). And one does not want to build a large distributed file system or a large RAID array for that. What we want is a simple 1U Pizza box that can be deployed anywhere without too much fuss where 100G lines are deployed.\r\n\r\nThis talk is going on a journey through the various hardware and software considerations to get a box like that configured and talks about numerous hard lessons learned as to what works and what did not. On the way we encounter numerous hardware and software limitations that seem to be blocking the way and that required creative solutions.",

      "abstract": "Six or so years ago, input devices in userspace were handled by a set of different modules, all with their own properties and behaviours. Where a device didn't work as expected, it was largely up to the users to find the right forum with examples that actually work. This had worked \"well\" for about a decade or two.\r\n\r\nThen, largely driven by the promise of the differently-shaded pastures of Wayland, a new library was born: libinput. The prime motivation behind this library was to have a  unified input stack that works well out of the box for any device, regardless of the display server. libinput is now the input backend for all major Wayland compositors and the default X.org input driver.\r\n\r\nThis talk goes through the motivations behind libinput and its design choices. Why and how is it different to what we had before? Why can we handle mice, touchpads, tablets, touchscreens but not joysticks? Or the weird but common question: Why are there no configuration options? (Spoiler alert: there are quite a few.) The talk will explain how some of the devices work, how we handle them and  why certain behaviours are required and/or at last need to be worked around. I will explain the various current and future features and our plans to improve them. And where we went wrong. Because if it wasn't for the error part of \"trial and error\", everyone would think that we know what we're doing.\r\n\r\nThis talk is about technical details, but intended to be accessible to everyone. You won't need to know programming to understand it, but you'll probably leave knowing more about devices than you want to know.",

Since then, it has grown into one of the most popular cross-platform open source spatial desktop tools available, with an ever-growing developer and user base, widely used in many sectors, even as a full replacement for commercial offerings.  This growth has not come without cost or growing pains to the project and community.  A growing user base and an ongoing effort to be taken as a serious alternative to commercial offerings have led to a shift in developer and user expectations for the project.  \r\n\r\nAs QGIS has grown into areas and user bases the early developers never dreamed of, some of the feelings the project had have changed, and this might have zapped some of the fun.  Was this inevitable, as we pushed the project with more and more features and promotion in the spatial community?  How do you maintain the same feel for the project, while at the same time becoming more serious?\r\n\r\nWhat about the users and the community?  Have their expectations now changed for the project? At what point did we notice a change in the community and the levels of service we were required to live up to?\r\n\r\nLong-term-release, better build process, better documentation, UI translations into many languages; these all make great software, but at a cost for a mostly volunteer-run project. When does the project switch from pure volunteer to a more commercial entity?",

      "abstract": "Compass, the UI for MongoDB, is an Electron app that allows developers to visually develop aggregations and queries for their database. Right now it accepts these queries in the MongoDB Shell syntax, a JavaScript-based query language. However, developers use a wide range of programming languages in their apps, and constant context switching between languages can be painful. To cure this pain, we wanted to allow users to export the queries they built in Compass into whatever programming language they wanted. Even better, we wanted to also allow users to write their favorite language directly into Compass. To achieve these goals, we needed a way to translate query syntax in any programming language into query syntax in any other language, so we needed to write a multi-language-input to multi-language-output transpiler in web-friendly JavaScript!\r\n\r\nFurther, since MongoDB has so many diverse and passionate language communities, I really wanted the transpiler to be \u201cpluggable\u201d - community members should be able to add their favorite language to Compass without needing to be compiler experts or know about what other languages were implemented. It is not enough to simply open source the code and hope people contribute. The compiler was architected with distributed collaboration in mind from the very start, and this talk will describe all the steps we took to make the barrier to contribution as low as possible.\r\n\r\nThis talk will go through the technical design of the anything-to-anything pluggable transpiler and teach attendees how they can add their own favorite language to Compass. I\u2019ll talk about classic compiler design principles and how I leveraged various compiler technologies to create a dynamic, extensible transpiler. Lastly, I\u2019ll talk about how we can take this transpiler and apply it to an abundance of other use cases!\r\n\r\nWho should attend?\r\n\r\nAnyone with an interest in open source, compilers, parsers, Compass, MongoDB, ANTLR, or a general passion for complex technical problems is welcome. I will talk about classic compiler design without requiring attendees to be programming-language experts, although any knowledge of compiler implementations will be useful. Attendees will leave the talk knowing exactly how to extend Compass to support new languages and will hopefully be inspired to go out and add their favorite language to Compass!\r\n\r\nWhy should they attend?\r\n\r\nThis talk addresses both MongoDB-specific challenges as well as highly technical computer science problems. Attendees will learn not only about Compass itself, but about compiler design. As developers we use compilers every day, but it is not so often that we get the opportunity to actually write them, and compilers are awesome!",

      "abstract": "The condensation of virtually everything into a single device -- the smartphone -- has normalized deviant behaviors that create security risks. For example, many smartphone users conduct secure transactions while juggling several other apps, thus creating opportunities for adversaries to exploit human error. Furthermore, running both secure and insecure code on a common CPU increases the risk of exposing user secrets thanks to microarchitectural side channels --  a large, complex, and opaque attack surface.\r\n\r\nSystem architects have introduced \"secure enclaves\" as a technique to minimize the attack surface between sensitive secrets and an untrusted CPU. In theory, secret key material never leaves the perimeter of the enclave \u2013 keys are generated and stored permanently within the enclave. Regardless of the implementation details, secure enclaves inevitably rely on an untrusted CPU to relay messages to the user. This is because there is typically just one screen and keyboard presented to the user, and these elements are directly connected to the untrusted CPU. Thus, secure enclaves can only protect keys from being compromised; they cannot protect the data itself from compromise. \r\n\r\nThis talk introduces Betrusted, a device designed to partition a set of secure applications into a physically separate device that is designed using security-first principles: the hardware is simple, open source, and is user-verifiable from the keyboard to the LCD. Putting secure apps on a separate screen also helps users focus on their secure transactions, while minimizing attack surfaces and eliminating microarchitectural sidechannels. The Betrusted project\u2019s scope will eventually range from secure silicon all the way to application layer code, and we are looking for developers of all stripes who are interested in contributing to the project.",

As these traditionally paper-based manifestations find expression in electronic formats, institutions envision \u201cnew ways of locating, interacting with and sharing information about archival material\u201d. In some cases, institutions are proactively releasing finding aids, such as indexes, as open datasets. In others, electronic index data is being hacked, liberated from behind institutional interfaces and set free as open data. This presentation takes the audience on a series of short data journeys provoked by hacked index data made free. It makes the argument for greater support for and release of open data by cultural heritage institutions. \r\n\r\nThese data-driven stories of discovery and exploration take us into the past, and inspire us to ask new questions of these materials. Is there, for example, a link between occupation and location as evidenced by the visualisation of index data for the unemployed in Sydney, 1866?\r\nWas a spike in data extracted from the publican licences index for the 1850s a result of the NSW gold rush?

In this talk, we will demonstrate a solution to this problem that we plan to propose for standardisation within the Open Container Initiative (code-named \"OCIv2 images\").\r\n\r\nThis talk is specific to the Open Container Initiative's image specification, but the same techniques could be applied to other systems (though we'd obviously recommend using OCI). \r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the [numerous issues with tar archives](https://www.cyphar.com/blog/post/20190121-ociv2-images-i-tar) it is necessary to come up with a different format. In addition, layer representations result in needless wasted space for storage of files which are no longer relevant to running containers. Massive amounts of duplication are also rampant within OCI images because tar archives are completely opaque to OCI's content-addressable store.\r\n\r\nLuckily the problem of representing a container root filesystem for distribution is very similar to existing problems within backup systems, and we can take advantage of prior art such as [restic](https://restic.net/) to show us how we can get significant space-savings and possibly efficiency savings.\r\n\r\nHowever, we also must ensure that the runtime cost of using this new system is equivalent to existing container images. Container images are efficient at runtime because they map directly to how overlay filesystems represent change-sets as layers, but with some tricks it is possible for us to obtain most of the improvements we also gained in distribution with de-duplication.\r\n\r\nOur proposed solution to all of these problems will be laid out, with opportunities for feedback and discussion.",

      "abstract": "TL;DR: Configuration is code, and config changes should be treated with at least as much care, skepticism, and rigour as code changes are.  Config presents special challenges though as it's usually not a fully operational Turing equivalent language, but has a high \"force multiplier\" per character relative to code itself.  let's explore those challenges and how we can address them to reduce the risk of configuration-change-related outages. \r\n\r\nOver ten years ago Puppet Labs and others espoused the idea of \"configuration as code,\" setting a course that crossed DevOps, the APIfication of systems, the Cloud, and Serverless.  Today, you can write a few lines of config and invoke thousands of CPUs, doing hundreds of operations, deploying entire clusters of systems, a huge force multiplier for IT operations.\r\n         \r\nThis force multiplier comes at a cost, and that cost is risk and impact.  Never before has it been so easy to destroy an entire CDN in a single command. While numbers vary, studies show that a significant number of incidents in IT operations are caused by configuration changes. \r\n\r\nConfiguration *is* code (and I'll prove it), but it sure lacks the same rigour that code receives. Configuration formats like YAML and JSON do not have the same quality of syntax checkers and debuggers that languages like C++, Go, and Ruby have.  Often the first time you know that a configuration is semantically correct is when it is running in production.\r\n                                                                               \r\nSo what can we do about it?  Why does this presenter think that a comparison between configuration format and a debugger is even possible?\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we'll start by looking at this problem from a theoretical point, which will let us look to other areas that solve a similar problem, and then see how we can apply that perspective back to configuration to make future production changes safer than today.",

      "abstract": "Rust is often described as having a difficult learning curve. Let\u2019s find a hidden escalator. By the end of this tutorial, you\u2019ll find building a command-line utility in Rust to be about as easy as one that\u2019s written in Python or Ruby, and you\u2019ll be able to distribute it as a stand alone binary.\r\n\r\nMany of the difficulties learning Rust emerge from two sources: jargon and novel concepts. Avoiding the jargon keeps some the cognitive capacity in reserve to focus on the new concepts. Much of jargon has its roots in Rust\u2019s functional programming heritage and early-adoption by programming language theorists. It\u2019s possible to bypass much of that and focus on getting something working first. There\u2019s plenty of time to learn about affine type systems and \r\nmonomorphisation once you\u2019ve got a working project or two.\r\n\r\nThis practical tutorial will take you through the process of writing a command-line from scratch. We\u2019ll learn all about the essentials of the language, as well as the tooling that\u2019s available for people who may not have worked with a compiled language before. We\u2019ll also spend some time talking about how  to access further help when you\u2019re working on your own.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of its life cycle, everyone who knows Rust learned something else first. That means that there are plenty of people in your position who have been able to push through and make progress.\r\n\r\nCome and learn Rust!",

Although systemd has some shortcomings and earns some criticism, it can ease your automation of handover / failover when combined with the new unit-file template generator from the long-distance data replication component MARS. It is very flexible, supporting arbitrary application stacks, e.g. virtual machines, containers, and much more.\r\nMARS is used by 1&1 IONOS for geo-redundancy of thousands of LXC containers, and on several petabytes of data, with very low cost.",

      "abstract": "Historically authentication was by username and password, perhaps with email as a password reset flow.   Users often wrote down their passwords (particularly older users), and possibly they only had a few passwords and it was pretty easy to try all of them.\r\n\r\nModern times have proven that passwords, particularly reused passwords, are insufficient security for any slightly valuable account.  So lots of people are using password managers, randomised passwords, and 2FA (hardware tokens, TOTP, etc).  Some accounts also require an additional authentication flow (email, SMS) for \"new device\" logins.  \"Security Aware\" users are using randomised answers to security challenge questions, perhaps also stored in their password managers.\r\n\r\nThis \"security improvement\" has a flip side: it's gone from being unlikely users will forget their passwords or get locked out, to being more likely users will lose access to their accounts through loss of 2FA or additional authentication paths (eg, phone number, or email), and more likely that users will struggle with lost password recovery.   And there's a darker side still: if the user is incapacitated, or has passed away, often someone else close to them will need to act \"on their behalf\" with those accounts (for legitimate transactions, send out notifications, or just to archive the account), and will likely struggle to gain access to them without the original users full set of password manager / 2FA / etc.\r\n\r\nHow do we balance the need to improve authentication security, and reduce the simplicity of malicious account takeover, with the need for there to be a way for legimate account use by bereaved family members, or other trusted associates?   There are no easy answers here, but considering the questions is important.",

      "abstract": "PokerSource, a now-defunct project, was AGPL'd/GPL'd end-to-end online poker system that was deployed for play-money games.  The server was written in Python and its most popular client, jPoker, was written in pure Javascript using jQuery, and was the very first deployed online poker system with a functioning pure Javascript client.  The project had a long hobbyist lifespan, dating back to the base C fast hand-evaluator library begun in the late 1980s.  During a brief period in the late 2000s, many developers were funded both full and part-time to work on the system, and the system was deployed and widely used on a major Facebook-competitor site.\r\nThe history of the PokerSource project is an interesting case study to analyze how proprietary software technologies, particularly for interactive online systems, readily and handily beat FOSS: even when FOSS was early to market and when the proprietariness of the software actually directly hindered trust in the userbase.\r\nThis talk will tell the history of this project, how a team of developers worked together to make a successful business out of of FOSS online poker.  The talk will unabashedly analyze both the successes and failures of our effort.  Attendees can learn what we did absolutely right in trying to build a FOSS business ecosystem for poker, and also the mistakes we also made along the way that assured FOSS demise in the world of online poker.  Attendees can learn from the successes and mistakes to assure your FOSS project isn't ultimately made obsolete by proprietary technology.",

      "abstract": "In an increasingly digitised world, societal understandings of the intersection between innovative technologies, ethics, and human rights have never been more critical. However, different cultures and different sectors have differing understandings of all these things. A simple categorisation of human data as being either public or private is insufficient to describe the complexities of a single human social group, let alone the full complexity of human life and interaction that is being recorded in more and more detail every day.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, understanding the social impacts of this new regime of digital data is integral to facilitating economic, social and health benefits, without further entrenching inequality for already vulnerable peoples within society. Furthermore, the application and impact of innovative technologies from all sectors including the tech industry is highly dependent on social acceptance, which cannot avoid public debates around ethics, human rights, and responsible innovation.\r\n\r\nThere are currently many conversations about the usage of human data and issues of privacy, ethics, and digital human rights in government, academia, activist communities, technology in general, and the information security and open data communities in particular. Unfortunately, most of these conversations are happening independently of each other, and as such are missing out on the knowledge, experience, and perspectives of other sectors.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is a discussion between an anthropologist (Dr Amelia Radke) specialising in digital human rights and a data infrastructure engineer (Betsy Alpert) on how the notions of privacy, security, and ethics play out in our respective fields. We argue that good data needs collaboration and deliberate design, particularly in an our ever more data-centric world.",

This talk covers:\r\n\r\n    \u2022 How human rights is directly linked to computer science via the legal text of these EU laws\r\n    \u2022 What new software solutions are required by these laws\r\n    \u2022 What long-standing bad internet security practices are banned according to the text of the law\r\n    \u2022 Examples of code based on long-standing open source libraries that meet the requirements of the new EU laws \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, security habits until recently classified as  \u201cbest practice\u201d are now moved to \u201cfix it  now or get off the internet\u201d, which is great news for those who have been advocating for better security for years. Infrastructure providers are required to be secure. Security algorithms known to be cracked may not be used. On the other hand, the EU has introduced new concepts in software-mediated contracts between infrastructure suppliers, and a new emphasis on the privacy of the endpoints in end-to-end communications. \r\n\r\nIn various ways, these laws affect how personal data and communications are handled outside Europe including in Australia, mandating better security and privacy. Which is just as well, because these are dark days for individual privacy in Australia.\r\n\r\nIn January 2020 the Australian Consumer Data Right bill is expected to become law, providing privacy protection to any \u201creasonably identifiable person, including a business enterprise\u201d, which includes persons such as News Corp and BHP. At the same time the Data Sharing and Release Bill will be enacted, which will remove more than \u201c500 existing data secrecy and confidentiality provisions across more than 175 different pieces of Australian Government legislation\u201d, ensuring that companies such as News Corp and BHP have easier access to Australian citizens\u2019 data. The Federal Court of Australia decided in 2017 that metadata is not personal data, so no doubt the Data Sharing and Release Act will indeed \"streamline delivery of citizen data services\" from the Australian Government to private companies.\r\n\r\nSuccessive Australian prime ministers and their governments believe that \u201cthe laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.\u201d   Not only do the laws of mathematics apply in Australia, but Australian companies wanting to do business that involves EU residents find themselves covered by EU laws, and EU laws have mathematics right at their core.\r\n\r\nInstead of (or as well as?) feeling despair at the state of privacy in Australia, the free software community can argue that there is an economic benefit in adopting an EU rights-based approach. Australian companies who deal with EU residents must comply with EU law. Maybe we can end up using the gold standard in privacy, even in Australia.",

The data extends over 70 years, from the 1920s through to the mid-1990s. This archive represents an important resource for understanding Australia\u2019s changing landscape as the majority of the collection predates high resolution satellite imagery.\r\n\r\nDigitisation of this archive is an ongoing priority as some of the original negatives are now very old and starting to degrade; but the approximately 280,000 images digitised so far are currently difficult to discover and access.\r\n\r\nSimilar but smaller archives of aerial photography are maintained by various state government agencies, and some are quite mature in their adoption of digital discovery and access, however each agency has implemented their own system, generally locked to a proprietary platform with little capacity for federating data across agencies.\r\n\r\nGA has therefore partnered with Data-61 under the Platforms for Open Data (PfOD) program to design and build a canonical metadata repository for images in the collection, and an open API for discovering and eventually accessing these images.  The project has a strong focus on open source and standards based solutions, with the hope that state government agencies will come on board, facilitating federated discovery of imagery across state and federally managed archives.\r\n\r\nThe project is a fascinating example of old technology meeting new, dealing with metadata sourced from nearly century-old hand-written documents on the one hand, and the latest cloud deployment technologies and emerging API standards for geospatial data discovery on the other.",

It is a requirement, not an option, if the Internet is going to scale.  Multicast allows application developers to add more functionality without significantly impacting the network.\"\r\n\r\nNearly two decades later, multicast is still largely ignored and misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThere are many common misconceptions about multicast, including that it is only useful for streaming video and audio.  It does so much more than that.\r\n\r\nMulticast is really about group communication.  It is, by definition, the most efficient way to distribute data to groups of nodes.\r\n\r\nThis talk explains why multicast is the missing piece in the decentralisation puzzle, how multicast can help the Internet continue to scale, better protect our privacy, solve IOT problems and make polar bears happier at the same time.\r\n\r\nMulticast brings with it a very different way of thinking about distributed systems, and what is possible on the Internet.  From database replication to chatops, server federation, configuration management and monitoring.\r\n\r\nEven applications, such as chat, which are fundamentally multicast in nature are being built on top of unicast protocols.  There is a Better Way.\r\n\r\nMulticast lets us do things that would be impossible with unicast.  Imagine sending software updates to a billion IOT nodes simultaeneously, using just one tiny virtual server.\r\n\r\nAt a time when even the web is moving to UDP with HTTP/3 and WebRTC, it is time we took a serious look at what we're missing by not using multicast at the network layer to underpin our Internet protocols.\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss how you can start using multicast in your project today, and how multicast design and thinking differs from unicast.  We'll cover some of the different types of IP multicast, the basics of multicast routing and how to build in TCP-like reliability.\r\n\r\nWe'll explore what can be done with multicast now, and look forward to how improvements in multicast can make a better Internet for the future.",

With digital licences springing up around the globe, including here in Australia, how can we be sure that the computer is telling the truth? Does digitising the process actually improve it?\r\n\r\nIn 2015, the NSW Government announced a commitment to providing digital licences so that people can identify themselves using their smartphones. After a limited trial in 2018 and 2019, the system is supposed to go live to users across the state some time soon. Other countries are trialling similar systems, and South Australia already has one.\r\n\r\nThe way this is presented it is largely as a black box, where \u02da\u2727\u208a\u204e magic happens \u204e\u207a\u02f3\u2727\u0f1a and your identity is somehow proven. For many people, particularly tech-savvy folk, magic is not a sufficient explanation, nor a basis for trust.\r\n\r\nUsing the NSW digital licence system and associated app, this talk will:\r\n\r\n- have a look at authentication, authorisation and identity in the physical realm\r\n- investigate differences between real-world identity and digital identities\r\n- explore the inner workings of the New South Wales digital driver\u2019s licence system, based upon reverse-engineering\r\n- discuss why you should - or shouldn\u2019t - trust digital licensing systems, and how it impacts identity verification in your own lives",

Making a large infrastructure change is another matter. It can involve multiple sub-systems and a score of maintainers, all with their own development priorities.

In this talk he shares his experience dealing with the long development process, unresponsive or hostile maintainers, and surrounding technologies that change without warning. He offers recommendations on how to address conflicting feedback and identify when progress is stalled.",

      "abstract": "Moodle is an open source learning management system, popular with universities. As Moodle has aged, some aspects of its security have fallen well behind industry standards for security. This talk will discuss the measures that have been taken to bring it up to scratch, and the ways that this can be applied to any application. The first priority in improving the security of the platform was targeting its password policy, which suffers from the older model of 'You must have atleast 2 uppercase characters'. To address this, a new plugin was developed for the platform, which acts much more in line with current NIST guidelines, including checks for compromised passwords using the HaveIBeenPwned API, and a user's personal information. This talk will show the guidelines we worked against, and how it can be applied to any applications password flow.\r\n\r\nThe next challenge to tackle was the lack of ways to augment an authentication flow. There are a huge amount of ways to authenticate to a Moodle, with support for all major SSO services, however, no potential to augment this process with additional tools such as MFA. To this end, work was done with Moodle HQ to implement a platform for this functionality on all pages that require higher security, such as changing and resetting a user's password. This talk will discuss what we learned along the way, and how to avoid common problems when implementing an MFA system such as security questions.\r\n\r\nFinally, this talk will discuss the work that we are doing to implement MFA in a way that works alongside other authentication methods, such as SSO, with discussion on alternative factors, such as trusted IP networks.",

A common way for attackers to gain execution control is to target function pointers that were saved to memory. Control Flow Integrity (CFI) seeks to sanity-check these pointers and eliminate a huge portion of attack surface. It's possible to do this today with the Linux kernel (or any program) with Clang/LLVM's CFI implementation.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will discuss how Android is using Clang's CFI in the Linux kernel for recent phones, how it is being upstreamed, and what you can do to use CFI yourself. We will explore what Clang actually inserts for code, data, and symbols to protect indirect calls, what needed fixing in the kernel to support it, and what's still missing. We'll wrap up with a short demo of CFI foiling a kernel attack.",

      "abstract": "History never unfolds as we would expect.  It's surprising and jarring that we've achieved both so much and so little.  Every day, there is more Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in the world than ever in history, but it's also a little bit harder each day to live a life that avoids proprietary software.  Today's world of software technology is a ridiculous paradox. \r\n\r\nMost software that we depend on every day is under someone's else control.  Whether it's the cloud service run by a big company, the medical devices that keep us alive, or the Javascript application for everything from our banking to our social media, the code that handles our most sensitive data and life-essential computing tasks is usually proprietary.  Even Linux-based devices, which are ubiquitous, rarely comply with the GPL and therefore are more-or-less almost as proprietary as any other device.  Linux is everywhere, yet early FOSS adopters have never had less software freedom than we do today.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, it was viable for someone living in the industrialized world to function in daily society in pure software freedom.  In those days, being a software freedom activist was akin to being a vegan or vegetarian: activists could (relatively conveniently) live a lifestyle that reflected our values and proved our sociopolitical point in mundane, daily terms.\r\n\r\nLeading by example is not so easy anymore.  The strongest supporters of software freedom among us, if they chose to remain living in the industrialized world, make compromises.  Our political opponents  tell us that our cause is misguided since these compromises \"aren't so bad\".  Meanwhile, our would-be political allies question our commitment to the cause because we carry devices with some proprietary firmwares.  Navigating this complex climate may well be the hardest challenge we face.\r\n\r\nCooptation is commonplace for social justice movements, and the cooption process can be ongoing for decades.  The software freedom movement is a few years into this cooption: this is precisely why we see major leaders stand up and shout \"Open Source is the default; Open Source has won!\" while presenting slides from a Macbook.  The most difficult days don't lie behind us; they lie ahead.\r\n\r\nThis talk is about surviving the personal struggle of software freedom activism in this current climate.  Many of us want a world with only FOSS and no proprietary software, but it's unlikely we'll liberate ourselves from proprietary software in our lifetimes.  How do we live our lives to maximal effect to carry forward the torch of software freedom both in this generation and onto the next?  How do we weather the inevitable failures and seemingly insurmountable challenges as we watch what was once FOSS slowly become proprietary again, or see new technologies exist only as proprietary, or, even worse, exist as a warped version of FOSS that \"seems open\" but fails to give most software freedoms to most users?  Let's learn and explore together how to survive as activists now that the going got tough.",

Unlocking and automating the WhatsApp channel is a pre-requisite for scaling businesses in the 3rd world where this is a dominant communication medium. In the third-world and from my personal experience in Kenya a lot of businesses run on the command-line, the command-line being the WhatsApp message text entry box. This talk describes means of putting shell processor behind that command line to parse natural language, emoji and semi-structured data to capture issues from the field (stderr), information from the field (stdout) and to forward parsed data to order management, tickets and other systems (pipe,redirect).\r\n\r\nWe will cover initial unofficial attempts including:\r\n-  Direct HTTP protocol unlocking \r\n-  Using Headless browsers such as PhantomJS/Puppeteer with WhatsApp for Web\r\n-  Using Android Notifications API to forward messages to another app\r\n-  Using rooted Android phones to uncrack the encrypted db and forward content\r\n-  You can't stop the screenshot\r\n\r\nRecently there are more official channels for general purpose automation and CRM / Support Chat integrations via\r\n- Twilio\r\n- FreshChat\r\n- Zendesk\r\n- Others as WhatsApp graciously grants access\r\n\r\nWe have firsthand experience with the Twilio Whatsapp API / Python SDK which should be familiar to anyone having using Twilio API before. This is layered with text comprehension advances from modern Neural Network based approaches to create effective automated customer service , order creation and field data capture solutions.\r\n\r\nA lot of Python web development has focused on building API's  ( stateless), User-interfaces targeting the browser etc. however Chat as UI requires a stateful backend which has memory and uses context effectively to craft responses. These bots are often domain specific and little attempt is made to be Turing-passing as opposed to being functional with semi-structured input.\r\n\r\nSemi-structured input can be flexibly parsed using mostly rule based NLP, deep learning based NLP is the flavour of the day and only becomes necessary for processing client input (from users outside the organization who cannot be effectively change managed). Tools in the classic python NLTK library for processing WhatsApp data include:\r\n- Stemmers\r\n- Tokenizers\r\n- Fuzzy Matchers\r\n- Regular expressions ( for deterministically named entities such as truck registration, containers numbers, vessel names etc.)\r\n\r\nWhen push comes to shove, the data can be piped via one of the cloud NLP platforms as well. Overall the humans in the WhatsApp treadmill can be assisted by machines to systematize the flood of words.",

In the modern age of material design, Visual Design Group's and Human Interface Guidelines this balance has very much shifted to be in favor of function over form, an interface that looks good is still important but looks always seem to play a distant second to usability. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this talk is to explore what happens when you flip that idea and rather then focusing on creating user interfaces that are primarily usable instead focus on creating user interfaces that are works of art with a lesser regard as to how easy they are to use.\r\n\r\nFortunately this idea is nothing new, in the late 90's Raster founded the enlightenment desktop inspired by the artistic user interfaces of the games he played growing up, he brought these concepts to the desktop.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of graphics hardware in the mid two thousands lead us to the world of fish tanks inside cubes, wobbly windows and painting fire on the screen. Not because there was any real need or use but because someone could. Sadly since then the world of the Linux desktop has tried to go all professional and many of the fun interesting things have been lost.\r\n\r\nIn the last year or so I have been working on reviving some of these old themes for Enlightenment with a hope to get people creative about UI development again for fun. As well as showing off some of the things above from the past this talk will discuss how you can go about managing changes in large numbers of themes for new versions through using version control and scripting to automatically change the color of icons etc.\r\n\r\nOver the years I have done some theming for various different Linux desktops and I will also spend some time covering what is and isn't possible in various desktops.",

In this presentation, I am sharing some techniques I have seen people (developers and writers) use.  These tricks are easy to use, and writers can quickly adapt them to their writing workflow. This presentation isn't about learning git basics or understanding git commands, but rather, using aliases and bash functions to handle typical Git workflow commands we use daily.\r\n\r\nUsing aliases and bash functions, allow you to map easy English terms for the Git commands you use every day. For example, to create a new branch, you can run the command `git newbranch <branch-name>` instead of `git checkout -b <branch-name>`. Which is more logical and saves you from remembering the actual command. This example is a simple operation, you can also use these techniques handle complex tasks, such as downloading someone else's pull request (or merge request) for review.",

In this talk, we will take a look at one way to reduce the attack surface of your software; testing via static code analysis and dynamic analysis.  We will touch on the theory of how this technology works, when to use it during your development cycle, and then do a few live demos of a sampling of popular tools available for free to the Open Source community that you can leverage today to produce more secure software.

This talk also contains a deep dive in the linux kernel module for SPI drivers.\r\n\r\nThe initial iterations of the design used ESP8266 and then ESP32 as the host processor. The firmware has evolved from Arduino Wiring/C++ to Micropython. My recent efforts have been focused on transitioning a to full-linux capable host processor while delegating the real-time processing and energy computations to ASIC's and FPGA's with ADC extensions. The energy monitor specific code running on the Linux CPU is envisaged to be written in Python for ease of portability and iteration.",

      "abstract": "Education is a vital component of human society. Our young are born relatively underdeveloped compared to many other species. We sacrificed a longer development in utero for larger brain size. Thus we are born needing to learn and geared to learn as fast and efficiently as possible, even adapting our brain architecture to suit the material we learn, and sadly, discarding areas that are not developed. During the long millennia of human (pre)history, we have adapted how we educate each other. This presentation will whip through the last 100,000 years with a very brief overview of how education has changed and what we have learned about the process on the way. The 'open' context of human societies through time in the context of education is also examined, with a goal of distilling information that has application in our modern lives and our approach to open education in the current sense.\r\nWe will examine what 'education' means in different human societies and through time; and the implications of an 'open' approach and how that fits with different ways of organising society. What has worked well, how can we define and measure that, and how we can apply it in our modern world, which is so very different to anything that has gone before are all topics to be addressed. We will also touch on the aspects of human psychology that are influenced by our evolutionary biology and what that means for how we teach and learn, as well as how we can work most effectively. The separation of 'work' and 'education' is a very modern phenomenon and one that some of our ancestors might find hard to comprehend. Thus, looking at education through time can teach us a lot about how humans can optimise living in all spheres of their lives.",

The focus will be on the use of the tools, eeschema to design the circuit and pcbnew to layout the PCB.\r\n\r\nYou will be shown each technique then given time to practice it by finishing off the other elements while I circulate to assist. Awkward silences will be filled by discussions of the design decisions that have been taken, amusing anecdotes and opinionated advice on what consists of good design. Checkpoints with preprepared files for catchup will be provided in case you struggle in any particular area\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you have Kicad 5 installed and have tested that it runs, we will not have time during the session to fix faulty installs. You will also need an internet connection to be able to download preprepared files and pdf datasheets.",

The existing unix commands that come with any linux/bsd distro, along with streams/pipelining, plain text and a lack of mouseclicks are just a few of the attractions.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, ClickOps seems to be on the rise - largely due to enterprise web applications with suboptimal (or absent) CLI tools.  Many of us have been spending more time in the AWS Web Console than we would like for this very reason.\r\n\r\nBash-my-AWS is a simple but extremely powerful set of CLI commands for managing resources on Amazon Web Services. They harness the power of Amazon's AWSCLI, while abstracting away the verbosity. The project implements some innovative patterns but (arguably) remains simple, beautiful, readable and easily extensible.\r\n\r\nBy emitting line oriented output instead of JSON, Bash-my-AWS commands work well  in pipelines with other standard unix commands. Additionally, the commands take a novel approach to handing STDIN that  greatly improves the user experience.\r\n\r\nThe talk will introduce the project and describe it's novel use of pipelining to improve the user experience.\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://bash-my-aws.org\r\nGit: https://github.com/bash-my-aws/bash-my-aws",

      "abstract": "Open hardware for embedded and general purpose applications with low to medium compute performance requirements has become almost commonplace, a response to a growing understanding of the need for solutions that embrace libr\u00e9 principles.\r\n\r\nOpen hardware for server class/high performance computing requirements is a relatively new concept but is, appropriately, becoming an area of focus for data centres, supercomputers, and security conscious workstation/end users alike. Contributors to the OpenPOWER project have been working together to create an open ecosystem based around the POWER Instruction Set Architecture that enables truly open -and- high performance compute solutions. \r\n\r\nThe resultant systems extend from high performance embedded systems, desktop workstations up to the worlds fastest supercomputers and have an entirely open software stack - firmware to remote management to hypervisor to OS to applications.  Many of the systems have hardware that is likewise entirely open source at the schematic, PCB and, increasingly component level.\r\n\r\nPut colloquially: OpenPOWER systems are the only commodity high performance systems out there that don\u2019t have any funny hidden management engines, or binary blobs of executable code in their firmware.  Some even ship with a recovery DVD that in addition to the full source code for everything running on the machine, include the schematics and other technical drawings too.\r\n\r\nThis session will explain the importance of open hardware and software at all levels of the compute environment - embedded/IoT to desktop to hyperscale systems. From here a brief introduction to OpenPOWER and the OpenPOWER Foundation as well as an update on the ecosystem, the status of the hardware and software stacks in question as well as an overview of some of the OpenPOWER hardware out there.  There will be at least one system of great interest to LCA attendees that will have it's Oceania debut at this talk.\r\n\r\nThis will be a technical/community/ecosystem talk, not a \u201csales pitch\u201d :)",

Architectures beyond x86 are rarely discussed. This talk will give you a glimpse into the modern mainframe running Linux, and why it and other alternative architectures like ARM and POWER should be considered.\r\n \r\nWe\u2019ll first look at the birth of time-sharing and the first Virtual Machine (VM) technology that surfaced on the mainframe in the 1970s, driven by community-based efforts and with help from one of the oldest computer organizations in the world. From there, we\u2019ll have a look at how VM technology allowed Linux to be run on the mainframe by a group of hobbyists in the late 1990s, and then was swiftly noticed by IBM and development continued for the polished product we see today.\r\n \r\nToday, there is an entire product line of mainframes that exclusively run Linux (RHEL, SLES, or Ubuntu) rather than the data-focused, batch-processing operating systems they are best known for. For the security-conscious, encryption technology built into the processor and on additional PCIe cryptography cards is accessible in Linux, allowing for end-to-end encryption of data at rest and in flight that doesn\u2019t burn all of your regular processing resources. Enterprise-grade hardware that also has built-in redundancy reduces the need for management of a fleet of x86 servers, and the entry level mainframes today even fit into a 19\u201d rack space in the datacenter. There are even a few services in the cloud run by IBM that transparently to the user use a mainframe in the back end.\r\n\r\nLooking at the future, with policies and laws making data protection even more important, there will be an increasing need for systems that have hardware-driven encryption technologies built in. Power consumption from these increasing needs will also continue as the rate of on-demand data processing and storage continues to soar. As a result, we'll likely see alternative architectures that put power savings become increasingly compelling.",

It details practical advice and lessons learned from the speaker's personal experience taking the HarfBuzz library from a starting point with virtually no documentation to a full-fledged set of internal and external references, plus code-integration and end-user guides.\r\n\r\nThe topics covered will include designing documentation from the top down as an \"alternative API\" to the code itself, strategies for staging a large documentation project is discrete parts that can be deployed successively, building documentation in a continuous-integration environment, and practical tips for documentation teams.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will also showcase the benefits of rolling out documentation in parallel to development, including insights on system architecture and improved community involvement.",

      "abstract": "Since 2002, Linux has used huge pages to improve CPU performance.  Originally, huge pages supported 2MB pages on x86.  They evolved to support other architectures and, eventually, 1GB pages on x86.  Despite this relative success, the huge page mechanism is not flexible enough to support related hardware features.  One desirable feature is a \"medium\" large page size (e.g., ARM CPUs support a 64kB page size).  Another is a larger page size (e.g., some network devices support pages as large as 2GB).\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will argue that using larger pages to reduce software overhead is as important as enabling hardware optimisations.  I'll talk about the recent patches to improve the performance of larger pages in the page cache.  I'll also talk about patches to bring support for larger pages to normal filesystems.  And I'll talk about some of the downsides of using larger pages, and some of the future limitations of using larger pages.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for kernel developers and those who are interested in learning more about how some hardware works.  Since these optimisations are supposed to be transparent to user space, no changes should be needed to userspace code to take advantage of them.  End users should only notice their web browsers running faster, their database queries completing faster and their birds being slightly less angry.",

Where, when and how is it being collected? Do those who agree to this data collection really know what they are handing over? And are those who don't agree having any success at protecting their personal data?\r\n\r\nI will show you how extensive is the information Facebook openly admits to collecting (if you know where to look!), and how easy it is for Facebook to collect it without your knowledge. You will also see how third parties routinely gather your data from other websites, in many cases without the website owner realising. \r\n\r\nWe will look at a real world example by analysing a fairly typical website of a well-known company that isn't known for its data collection, to see what sorts of things it is sending to third parties. In addition, you'll see the results of research into what those third parties use the data for.\r\n\r\nFinally I will discuss what you can do if you wish to better protect your personal data, and some of the problems you may face, including why deleting your cookies may be counter-productive.",

In a new era of distributed systems at scale and connected embedded devices, data collection and processing becomes a real challenge; Logging has been forced to evolve and adapt to new needs. \r\n\r\nIn Data Analysis, logging is one of the key components to collect and pre-process data, usually, a logging mechanism goes through collect, parse, filter and centralize logs to a storage backend like a database, so data processing and analysis can be performed. This usually happens after the data has been aggregated and stored, but for real-time analysis needs, process the data while is still in motion brings a lot of advantages and this kind of approach is called Stream Processing.\r\n \r\nWhat if it was possible to query your data using aggregation functions, windowing, and grouping results while the data was in motion and in-memory but on the edge side?.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will go further and present an extended approach called 'Stream Processing on the Edge', where data is processed on the edge service or device, in a lightweight mode empowering features like anomaly detection (in the order of milliseconds) and Machine Learning in a distributed way using pure Open Source software.",
