While \"moving to the cloud\" poses an opportunity to cut costs and offers new possibilities with regard to scalability, it also creates new problems for system administrators. Many existing open-source monitoring solutions require a centrally configured list of hosts, for example, which is not possible to specify in a cloud environment. Configuring checks for individual hosts also makes less sense than it used to, and the focus is shifted to detecting a misbehaving site instead of fixing a single host.\r\n\r\ncollectd is a lightweight daemon which collects, processes and stores system and application performance metrics. It comes with over one hundred plugins for all sorts of systems, applications and devices. The daemon is very light-weight and is in wide-spread use in small devices (e.g. OpenWrt) as well as huge, ever changing cloud setups.\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the \"cloud\" end of the spectrum.

However, these mostly rely on pro-active governments providing that access voluntarily.\r\n\r\nThis opening up of government information is in part due to the excellent work done in the 1990s and 2000s pushing for the adoption of open data standards. This has enabled a greater adoption of open source software by governments.\r\n\r\nWhat we don't see is much government contribution back to open source projects. With only a few exceptions, most software developed for and by government remains closed source. In fact, these projects are often shrouded in secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe origins of open government policy can be traced to the passage of Freedom of Information (FOI) acts in the 1980s. These provide individuals with a statutory right of access to information produced by government. The basic idea behind FOI was that people should be able to see what their taxpayer dollars were funding.\r\n \r\nSo, can FOI be used to open up source code for these secretive projects? Perhaps - but not fully, and certainly not easily.\r\n\r\nThe software used in Australia\u2019s notoriously complicated Senate elections was developed in-house at the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and is called EasyCount. In October 2013 I submitted a FOI request asking for the source code for EasyCount and associated documentation. Access was refused on the basis that the code was a trade secret.\r\n\r\nThe AEC has fought hard to prevent the source code being seen by the public, or even scrutineers from political parties. They even refused to provide me with a list of documents identified.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m currently appealing the AEC\u2019s decision through the courts, thanks to more than $10,000 in crowd funding. In return the AEC has sought to have me declared a vexatious applicant. In the middle of it all the Senate passed a motion ordering the responsible minister to table the source code in Parliament, but the government refused to comply.\r\n\r\nEven if I win in court (which is far from certain), the code will still be protected by copyright. While the code might be available for inspection, none of the 260,000 lines of code will able to be reused for anything else.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a strong argument that major public investments in software development should result in code released under an open licence. I think FOI can be part of this process, but that we're only seeing the beginning of some major developments in open government policy.

Indeed, on many distributions uninstalling Samba\r\n(specifically tdb) uninstalls the whole desktop!\r\n\r\nSamba's progression up the stack starts with the provision of basic\r\nlibraries like tdb and talloc to client tools and libraries\r\n(libsmbclient, libnet and others).

Breeding is a numbers game. Each year PFR produces hundreds of thousands of new plant genotypes, the bulk of which are deliberately discarded before significant resource has been invested in growing them. Some plant characteristics cannot be observed until plants have reached reproductive maturity, which can take several years. Analysing a seedling\u2019s genetic sequence data with genomics tools provides an opportunity to identify early on whether it carries useful genes, such as those associated with disease resistance or fruit colour.\r\n\r\nThe compressed genetic sequence of a single plant can occupy hundreds of gigabytes. Generating such data is becoming cheaper every year - scientists respond by using sequencing technology more often, which increases reliance on robust data processing and management methods. Tracking sample processing requires careful identification and management of individual plants, their associated genotypes, any samples collected from those plants, and the locations of both plants and samples. PFR has developed several software assemblages to address this challenge.\r\n\r\n\"Kea\", a sample handling system developed using the Python-based Django framework and an underlying postgreSQL database, helps users to manage laboratory analysis of plant samples. Kea tracks hundreds of thousands of samples through laboratory processing. It uses Elastic Search for scalable indexing to provide rapid response times for data filtering and reporting.\r\n\r\n\"powerPlant\" provides scientists with the tools carry out their own bioinformatics (the science of managing and analyzing genetic data) using open source analysis tools such as Galaxy, Ensembl, and R-Studio. powerPlant employs the open source job scheduler OpenLava to allocate processing tasks from front end web servers to back end processing nodes and databases.\r\n\r\nOpen data directives like the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework (NZGOAL), Reproducible Research, and the desire to collaborate with other organisations led PFR to establish scinet.org.nz to share data sets. Each data set has a MediaWiki instance for commentary and content management, coupled with a data browsing application such as GBrowse, for manipulating and displaying annotations on genomes.\r\n\r\nPFR now has a single 300 TB file system capable of storing large datasets, but we currently lack smart ways of processing them. We use a range of Linux-based servers with RAM ranging from 84 GB to 4 TB with 8 to 160 hyper-threaded CPU cores. Typical analyses can fully utilize even the largest of these servers. Much of current Information Technology industry activity is about \"dividing the hardware\" or even the OS itself into tinier chunks. In contrast, we need to identify how to divide a single process and distribute it across multiple servers to maximize resource use. Standards like Open MPI are only partially adopted and numerous bioinformatics applications don't utilize processors across multiple servers.\r\n\r\nIn the future we plan to explore using systems like iRods to automate file and metadata handling, and perhaps enable asynchronous integrations with national processing facilities like NeSI.", "Title": "FLOSSing in the lab \u2013 What Plant and Food Research does with FLOSS", "URL": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30122/view_talk", "Event": 123, "Start": "2015-01-15 15:40:00", "Presenter_emails": "zane.gilmore@gmail.com", "Presenters": "Zane Gilmore", "Duration": "0:45:00", "Id": 146, "video_release": "True", "Room Name": "OGGB 260-098"}, {"Description": "Before you can do serious analytics you need to have serious data.

SLUB is an allocator written for minimal queuing focusing on low instruction overhead in the fast paths instead.\r\n\r\nSlab allocators are providing basic memory allocation to kernel code. Often these allocations may occur in performance sensitive code (especially in the network and storage layer). Kernel performance is significantly affected by the slab allocators architecture and features. The talk provides an overview of the slab allocator services available in the Linux kernel and covers the most frequent use cases. The approaches used in the three slab allocators (SLAB, SLUB, SLOB) are compared and ways to get the maximum performance out of each of them are presented. Lastly a series of common gotchas when using slab allocators are reviewed followed by an open discussion on issues and the future of the slab subsystems.

Grace intends to reflect the last two decades' accumulation of knowledge on language design and teaching, and integrates well-known features that have proved themselves useful in other languages. Grace permits multiple approaches to program design and teaching, including object-, class-, procedure-, and function-based programming, with or without types, and allows moving between these approaches within the same language, so that students can be exposed to multiple approaches and instructors can tailor their courses to the topics they wish to teach.\r\n\r\nSupporting users at different stages of understanding is a key goal of Grace. While the main purpose of Grace is to be used for introductory programming courses, it is also a full-powered language incorporating the state of the art in language design. Different approaches and different levels of learning are supported by a feature called dialects: extended and restricted user-defined sub-languages applied on a per-module basis. Through dialects a learner need only see the functionality that is relevant to their stage of learning, with other features that might confuse the issue hidden, and can gradually move to an unrestricted language.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll outline the principal features of Grace and the philosophy behind them. I'll discuss the design choices made and the paths not taken, and describe the remaining open issues of the language. I'll talk about where language design can help programmers say what they mean, and talk particularly about the interesting pattern-matching and dialect features in Grace.\r\n\r\nI'll also look at what educational research tells us about learning to program and programming languages. I'll outline how that has influenced the design of Grace. In the same vein, I\u2019ll give some examples from the design process so far showing how conceptually orthogonal design decisions turn out to be deeply interrelated and require careful balancing with the goals of the language. I'll mention preliminary trials using Grace educationally.\r\n\r\nGrace has two existing open-source implementations. I'll introduce both of these, the self-hosted Minigrace compiler and the concurrent JavaScript-based Hopper interpreter.
