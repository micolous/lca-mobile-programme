Unfortunately, the root causes of many problems occur at a fine granularity that existing continuous profiling and direct measurement approaches cannot observe. This paper presents the design and implementation of SHIM, a continuous profiler that samples at resolutions as fine as 15 cycles; three to five orders of magnitude finer than current continuous profilers. SHIM\u2019s fine-grain measurements reveal new behaviors, such as variations in instructions per cycle (IPC) within the execution of a single function. A SHIM observer thread executes and samples autonomously on unutilized hardware. To sample, it reads hardware performance counters and memory locations that store software state. SHIM improves its accuracy by automatically detecting and discarding samples affected by measurement skew. We measure SHIM\u2019s observer effects and show how to analyze them. When on a separate core, SHIM can continuously observe one software signal with a 2% overhead at a ~1200 cycle resolution. At an overhead of 61%, SHIM samples one software signal on the same core with SMT at a ~15 cycle resolution. Modest hardware changes could significantly reduce overheads and add greater analytical capability to SHIM. We vary prefetching and DVFS policies in case studies that show the diagnostic power of fine-grain IPC and memory bandwidth results.

Internationalization support varies greatly by language, because each language needs particular features that may or may not work properly. One of the most challenging problems in language support is dealing with languages that are right-to-left, and the 500 million speakers of RTL languages often find themselves at the very bottom of the heap.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the support of those languages \u2013 on Linux, other operating systems, and on the Web \u2013 is so abysmal that it is hard to find a single piece of software that properly supports all the necessary behaviors.\r\n\r\nThe effect of right-to-left languages extends beyond the writing and reading of the script. The direction of reading has a significant psychological effect \u2013 where your eyes shift on the screen, your expectations of where interface elements should be, and what you expect when typing in a bi-directional setting.\r\n\r\nThe issues become even more complicated in an environment that handles bi-directionality. The questions of how systems should behave when two languages of two different directions interact become almost mind boggling. And yet, these are behaviors that right-to-left users encounter on a regular basis, and the solutions that are offered today prove to be extremely lacking. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I will cover some critical aspects that right-to-left users run into when dealing with software and websites, and potential solutions that are available, while concentrating on what developers should look out for and remember when they consider support for RTL languages.

The ESP8266 microcontroller has been hugely popular since it first appeared in 2014. Like many hardware devices, the ESP8266 incorporates a bunch of Free Software. But proprietary hardware and Free Software haven't traditionally been great friends...\r\n\r\nA black box at first, the ESP8266 has evolved to be unusually open for a very cheap embedded device. This process has been helped along by massive engagement from hobbyist and maker communities. It's also leveraged existing Free Software tools like the GNU C compiler. There are now multiple open source frameworks for programming the ESP8266, including a port of the Arduino IDE. There is a small but active reverse engineering community, which I'm part of, looking into ESP8266 internals. There are also projects like esp-open-rtos aiming to strip back layers of proprietary code to produce a more programmer friendly development environment.\r\n\r\nThe ESP8266 exemplifies a trend towards cheap ubiquitous hardware, a building block for the much-hyped \"Internet of Things\". It's also a product of the hugely competitive world of low end Chinese manufacturing - related to the \"gongkai\" notion of information sharing.

As the technology evolves, for example in the recent transition to IP-based broadcast, the needs of the market are continuously fluctuating. In order to successfully meet those needs, the key values to adhere to are openness, flexibility and interoperability. Our approach describes a Linux-based video broadcasting system that is built around these values.\r\n\r\nWe are greatly aided in this effort by the GStreamer framework. GStreamer is an open source pipeline-based multimedia framework, with pipelines dynamically constructed out of small composable components in a greater hierarchy.  GStreamer's open and flexible nature enables us to easily support multiple types of input and output, therefore enhancing interoperability while still relying on open standards. Furthermore, its GL extensions enables us to  use a cross-platform abstraction layer for GPU-accelerated video processing. Another important aspect in our use case is the ability GStreamer gives us to dynamically and seamlessly change the pipeline, adding and removing inputs and outputs as it runs without interrupting already running inputs or outputs.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we demonstrate the use of GStreamer in a distributed IP-based production environment, which still also support SDI inputs and outputs. It is location independent, meaning that several physically isolated pipelines can nicely work together over the network while still keeping synchronization.  Network synchronization is achieved by leveraging open standards like PTP, RTP/RTSP, which also allows interoperability with third party solutions.\r\n\r\nWe explain the architecture of our product and show the range of input and output types supported - for example, Decklink and URI (file or network) inputs can be combined, and the output can be shown locally, written to a file and also redirected to an RTSP server.

GlusterD is the daemon which manages the cluster configuration for Gluster.\r\n\r\nFor more information about Gluster please refer to http://www.gluster.org/\r\n\r\nWhat is Big-lock in GlusterD:\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGlusterD was originally designed as a single threaded application which\r\ncould handle just one transaction at a time. It was made multi-threaded to\r\nimprove responsiveness and support handling multiple transactions at a\r\ntime. This was needed for newer features like volume snapshots which could\r\nleave GlusterD unresponsive for some periods of time.\r\n\r\nMaking GlusterD multi-threaded required the creation of a thread\r\nsynchronization mechanism, to protect the shared data-structures (mainly\r\neverything under the GlusterD configuration, glusterd_conf_t struct) from\r\nconcurrent access from multiple threads. This was accomplished using the\r\nBig-lock.\r\n\r\nThe Big-lock is an exclusive lock, so any threads which needs to use the\r\nprotected data need to obtain the Big-lock and give up the Big-lock once\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nProblem with Big-lock\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Big-lock synchronization solution was added into the GlusterD code to\r\nsolve problems that arose when GlusterD was made multi-threaded. This was\r\nsupposed to be a quick solution, to allow GlusterD to be shipped.\r\n\r\nBig-lock as the name suggests, is a coarse grained lock. The coarseness of\r\nthe lock leads to threads contending even when they are accessing unrelated\r\ndata, which lead to some deadlocks.\r\n\r\nOne example of this deadlock is with transactions and RPC. If a thread\r\nholding the Big-lock blocked on network I/O it may result in a deadlock.\r\nThis could happen when the remote endpoint is disconnected. The callback\r\ncode would be executed in the same thread that has acquired the Big-lock.\r\nAll network I/O handlers, including callbacks, are implemented to acquire\r\nthe Big-lock before executing. From the above two, we have a deadlock.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, we release the Big-lock whenever a thread could block on\r\nnetwork I/O. This comes with a price. This opens up a window of time when\r\nthe shared data structures are prone to updates leading to inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nThe Big-lock, in its current state, doesn\u2019t even fully satisfy the problem\r\nit set out to solve, and has more problems on top of that. These problems\r\nare only going to grow with new features and new code being added to\r\nGlusterD.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe most obvious solution would be to split up the Big-lock into more fine\r\ngrained locks. We could go one step further and use replace the mutex locks\r\n(Big-lock is a mutex lock), with readers-writer locks. This will bring in\r\nmore flexibility and fine grained control, at the cost of additional\r\noverheads mainly in the complexity of implementation.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to readers-writer locks, we propose to use RCU as the\r\nsynchronization mechanism. RCU provides several advantages above\r\nreaders-writer locks while providing similar synchronization features.\r\nThese advantages make it more preferable to readers-writer locks, even\r\nthough the implementation complexity remains nearly the same for both\r\napproaches.\r\n\r\nRead-copy-update (RCU)\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nRCU, short for Read-Copy-Update, is a synchronization mechanism that can be\r\nused as an alternative to reader-writer locks.\r\n\r\nA good introduction to RCU can be found in this series of articles on LWN\r\n[1] and [2]. The articles are with respect to the usage of RCU in the\r\nLinux kernel, where it is used heavily.\r\n\r\nThe advantages that make RCU preferable to RWlocks are the following,\r\n\r\n- Wait free reads\r\nRCU readers have no wait overhead. They can never be blocked by writers.\r\nRCU readers need to notify when they are in their critical sections, but\r\nthis notification is much lighter than locks.\r\n\r\n- Provides existence guarantees\r\nRCU guarantees that RCU protected data in a readers critical section will\r\nremain in existence till the end of the critical section. This is achieved\r\nby having the writers work on a copy of the data, instead of using the\r\nexisting data.\r\n\r\n- Concurrent readers and writers\r\nWait-free reads and the existence guarantee mean that it is possible to\r\nhave readers and writers in concurrent execution. Any readers in execution,\r\nbefore a writer starts will continue working with the original copy of the\r\ndata. The writer will work on a copy, and will use RCU methods to\r\nswap/replace original data without affecting existing readers. Any readers\r\ncoming online after the writer will see the new data.\r\nThis does mean that some readers will continue to work with stale data,\r\nbut this isn't too big a problem as the data at least remains consistent\r\ntill the reader finishes.\r\n\r\n- Read-side deadlock immunity\r\nRCU readers always run in a deterministic time as they never block. This\r\nmeans that they can never become a part of a deadlock.\r\n\r\n- No writer starvation\r\nAs RCU readers don't block, writers can never starve.\r\n\r\nUserspace RCU\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe kernel uses features provided by the processor to implement its RCU.\r\nUserspace applications cannot make use of these features, but instead can\r\nuse the Userspace RCU library.\r\n\r\nliburcu [3] provides a userspace implementation of RCU, which is\r\nportable across multiple platforms and operating systems. liburcu also\r\nprovides some common data structures and RCU protected APIs to use them.\r\n\r\nAn introduction to URCU and its APIs can be found in this article on LWN\r\n[4].\r\n\r\n[1]: https://lwn.net/Articles/262464/\r\n[2]: https://lwn.net/Articles/263130/\r\n[3]: http://urcu.so/\r\n[4]: https://lwn.net/Articles/573424/\r\n", "Title": "Improving thread synchronization in GlusterD (Daemon for Gluster) using Userspace RCU (Read-copy-update)", "URL": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30007/view_talk", "Event": 31, "Start": "2016-02-03 13:20:00", "Presenter_emails": "amukherj@redhat.com", "Presenters": "Atin Mukherjee", "Duration": "0:45:00", "Id": 77, "video_release": "True", "Room Name": "Wool Museum"}, {"Description": "The Bourne shell is universally available on every Linux system, from the least-powerful embedded device, to the largest supercomputer.\r\nIn this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of:\r\nThe Shell's input: how it reads words, splits them, expands special stuff, etc.\r\nControl flow: case, if, while, for\r\nCommon utilities: sed, awk, grep, test, find, xargs, etc\r\n\r\nAfter some introductory material, we'll spend the time working together to build a simple server for fortunes/fables entirely in shell.\r\nTo see the result, do\r\n  telnet lemon.ertos.nicta.com.au 8500\r\n\r\nYou will need to bring a laptop with you to do the exercises.

In both cases these bugs were found using the latest fuzzing tools, one of them being American Fuzzy Lop (AFL). Using AFL the presenter then found and fixed numerous other bugs in these two projects.\r\n\r\nThen, in early 2015, as part of the Snowden relevations, the SSH protocol and/or common implementations like OpenSSH were briefly suspected of containing a flaw that was known only to the NSA. Fortunately this suspicion quickly fell out of favour but how can we know for sure that the NSA doesn't have an exploit for OpenSSH?\r\n\r\nThis open question led the presenter to try to figure out how to fuzz encrypted network protolcols like SSH. For OpenSSH, it turns out to be rather difficult but that is mainly a design flaw in OpenSSH itself. Software written to communicate over an encypted tunnel could easily be designed to make fuzzing relatively easy. The result is software that is more secure and robust.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will cover:\r\n\r\n* What is fuzzing?\r\n* What makes American Fuzzy Lop and the LLVM Fuzzer so much better than previous fuzzers?\r\n* How do the GGC and Clang compiler's sanitizer options assist in the fuzzing  process?\r\n* Using American Fuzzy Lop as a file input fuzzer.\r\n* Fuzzing network protocols (even encypted ones like SSH) with the LLVM Fuzzer.\r\n* Integrating fuzzing into your standard development process.\r\n", "Title": "Fuzz all the things!", "URL": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30243/view_talk", "Event": 56, "Start": "2016-02-05 11:35:00", "Presenter_emails": "erikd@mega-nerd.com", "Presenters": "Erik de Castro Lopo", "Duration": "0:45:00", "Id": 87, "video_release": "True", "Room Name": "Wool Museum"}, {"Description": "The unfortunate truth about networked applications is that an attacker only needs to know one thing you didn't know to get past your defenses.

Free and open source licenses are necessary in education, whether the learners are millions of primary school students in India or a vocational training class of twelve in North Carolina. The tools needed to meet these demands cannot exist or thrive without the practical and philosophical benefits of free and open source licenses.\r\n\r\nThese licenses are not only pragmatically useful for an individual platform, but necessary for future development. In order to educate a global population, resources, tools, and content must not only be adaptive and versatile, but also accessible, changeable, and shareable.\r\n\r\nUnder the lofty goal of \u201creaching a billion students,\u201d MOOC provider edX opened up their code base in 2013, releasing it under the AGPL. Later that day, the first pull request was made by someone outside of the company. Since then, the Open edX project has grown, with over 120 institutions and organizations using it independently to teach and train all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Open edX project is, in part, due to the choice to use the AGPL. This talk will provide an in-depth case study of the Open edX project as a free and open source software project. This will include governance, contributor metrics, and the practicalities of implementing and protecting the license.\r\n\r\nPractical benefits of being a free and open source project are frequently viewed from the perspective of providing free developer time or sweat equity contributions. This is also true within the Open edX project. Platform features and other development goals are met by edX, external contributors, and the two groups working in conjunction. However, many contributions are centered around organizations developing features or fixes based on their own needs. Meeting the demands of  internal development, external contributions, and edX stakeholders while fulfilling the promise made by adopting the AGPL has brought on anticipated hurdles, unexpected problems, and delightful challenges.", "Title": "Education and the AGPL: A Case Study", "URL": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30216/view_talk", "Event": 73, "Start": "2016-02-03 11:35:00", "Presenter_emails": "molly@edx.org", "Presenters": "Molly de Blanc", "Duration": "0:45:00", "Id": 125, "video_release": "True", "Room Name": "Costa Hall"}, {"Description": "The Systems Administration Miniconf focuses on professional management of real-world Linux and open source environments, both large and small.

This device might be so tiny that it mightn't even support memory protection - but you don't care, because you wouldn't run any code on this device anyway that you didn't fully trust. The code you do run, however, has to run on time and like clockwork, because that code drives a medical device or a ground or air vehicle, and lives are depending on it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you may have felt that this code of yours would be best expressed as a set of tasks that each have a clearly defined role, and you may be looking for an operating system that offers you just the means of specifying when those tasks need to happen, how long they get to run for, and how they should synchronize with each other when they need to coordinate their access to something. At the same time, you might need this code to compile to a binary that occupies no more memory than it strictly has to, because the power consumption or physical size of your device is a significant limiting factor in its deployment.\r\n\r\nThe eChronos Real-Time Operating System offers you a way to configure and build a statically resourced system of tasks, running code that you've written, to a schedule of your choosing. In this tutorial, we will teach you how to write, specify, and build systems that run on eChronos, and run them on the QEMU system emulator for ARMv7-M or PowerPC e500. We will also open the hood on the way the eChronos code base (available under the AGPLv3 license, on GitHub) is structured and maintained (with a view towards ease of certification), so that you can plan how you might port the eChronos RTOS to your own choice of hardware.", "Title": "Tutorial: The eChronos Real-Time Operating System - Just what you want, when you want it", "URL": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30189/view_talk", "Event": 99, "Start": "2016-02-05 10:40:00", "Presenter_emails": "stg@brkawy.com", "Presenters": "Stefan G\u00f6tz", "Duration": "1:40:00", "Id": 149, "video_release": "True", "Room Name": "D2.211"}, {"Description": "This talk will describe how an open source codec, modem, and open hardware can be used to improve two way VHF radio by a factor of 10.\r\n\r\nPush to talk two way radio is commonly used for police, emergency services, and the construction industry, with a world wide market of 50 million units/year.  It can be used with or without base stations, and has a range of 10s of km.\r\n\r\nSeveral two way digital radio systems exist and are in common use today, however these are hobbled by the use of closed source codecs, which add significantly to the radio costs, and prohibit experimentation.  There is frustration throughout the radio industry with closed source codecs.\r\n\r\nA team of open source developers has been working on open two way radio systems.  The team has demonstrated a performance increase of a factor of 10, which can be used in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\nTransmit power can be reduced\r\nBattery life can be extended\r\nRelatively high bit rate digital data can be sent\r\nHigh quality speech, or variable rate speech coding and quality\r\nThe range of the radios can be extended\r\nThe cost of the radio hardware can be greatly reduced due to low power, simple hardware, smaller batteries, and no codec license fees.\r\n\r\nThe use of Software Defined Radio (SDR) hardware is bringing the price of the hardware down, and open software is improving the functionality and performance.  The new, open two way radio protocol requires a new, open hardware radio design.
