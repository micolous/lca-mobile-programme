We aim to save New Zealand's native birds which are under threat from introduced predators such as possums, stoats, and rats. \r\n\r\nIn the last couple of years we have been busy developing digital solutions to monitor native bird populations and eliminate their introduced predators.\r\n\r\nThese solutions promise to be several magnitudes more effective than traditional approaches that are in use today. \r\n\r\nDuring our talk you will get to see and touch our thermal cameras and the machine learning model that we use to automatically identify animals.   We will also talk about our latest developments such as using audio based lures and our software controlled trap replacements. \r\n\r\nAs part our session we will also be discussing how we make open source for work us, as our project is not your average open source project.   This is due to our compelling but expansive vision, the start up phase we are in, and that our work spans software, hardware and science.\r\n\r\nCome and see what a handful of people have been able to achieve with the help of our dedicated open source community!",

      "abstract": "Learn how Open Source hardware and software can be used in a wide variety of assistive technologies, including wheelchair control, environmental systems, robotics, communication, prosthetics, games, and telepresence.\r\n\r\nTechnology can be used to dramatically improve the lives of people with physical disabilities. Often this takes the form of medical technology, which is a highly regulated field involving very high development costs and long product lifecycles.\r\n\r\nMedical technology is a critical element in supporting people with physical disabilities, and generally focuses on solving problems that are life-threatening or can otherwise be classified as having a medical imperative. Outside of medical technology that directly interacts with the human body, there is an enormous field of assistive technology that can be used to improve the lives of people both physically and mentally but does not have the same level of regulatory overhead.\r\n\r\nTechnologies that are frequently dismissed as gimmicks or toys, such as home automation systems and IoT devices, can be life-changing for people with disabilities. Not just toys for rich lazy people, home automation can make the difference between an individual being able to live independently or requiring residential care. Even more importantly, it can place the power back in the hands of the individual and give them the ability to control the world around them instead of relying on the help of others.\r\n\r\nBecause the needs of individuals can vary dramatically, the Open Source ethos of modularity, improvement, adaptation, and sharing is ideally suited to assistive technologies. Existing projects can be rapidly remixed and modified to suit specific requirements by combining open source software, hardware, and fabrication including 3D printing and CNC machining. Open Source technologies can give people with disabilities new powers far beyond what an average human can achieve, turning them into DIY superhumans.",

Taking things like NUMA locality, bus hierarchy, shared interrupts, cache locality, all into consideration, irqbalance is often misunderstood with how it works, what it can do, and what it cannot do.\r\n\r\nAs co-maintainer of irqbalance, this talk is intended to pull the curtain back on how this whole framework operates.  What pieces of the Linux kernel are involved in balancing interrupts, where policies are enforced, current best-known configurations, and future ideas to try and improve operation, are all things targeted with this talk.",

Optional end to end encryption keeps the data secure from users on the server, all crypto is done in the browser keeping it simple and secure for users.\r\n\r\nWhile a raw http and ftp server can be used to share files, many non technical users will not have access to upload and administer one of these servers. Access control to only selected users and automatic expiration of hosted files might be difficult for users more interested in research which is outside the IT field.\r\n\r\nFileSender supports push and pull models. To push, if you have access to a FileSender installation you can upload the file to it and inform those who you want to access the data to allow them to obtain it. To pull a file, you can create a guest on your FileSender install and invite a user to upload the data there. Guests can be subjected to specific access control, for example, only uploading a single file, and only to you.\r\n\r\nI would love to talk about the challenges the FileSender project tries to address, the php/js code that comprise it, the history, and development of FileSender.

Ftrace is a very powerful tool, but like all tools, it is useless if you don't know how to use it, or even know its full potential. This tutorial will teach you how to use Ftrace from the command line (all major distributions have Ftrace enabled), as well as how to use trace-cmd and finally, if time allows, the new KernelShark. trace-cmd and KernelShark can be easily downloaded from Steven's git repository on kernel.org (best to get the latest even though your distribution may have an older version available). Steven will first walk you through some of the main commands to display how Ftrace can show you how your applications are being scheduled in, how many page faults they are taking, and even see what other applications may be interfering with your main application. Some of these can be used to see if there's any rouge applications running on your system. Then Steven will walk you through how to use trace-cmd as it allows you to have even more flexibility with its post processing analysis. Finally, an introduction to the new KernelShark, which shows a graphic display of the data that you have retrieved.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the most from this tutorial, it is recommend that you:\r\n1) Have a laptop running a recent Linux distribution (Running in a VM will work too)\r\n2) Download and install the most recent trace-cmd and KernelShark\r\n  $ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/trace-cmd/trace-cmd.git\r\n  $ cd trace-cmd\r\n  $ make\r\n  $ less kernel-shark-qt/README # to make sure you have all the dependencies\r\n  $ make gui\r\n  $ make doc\r\n  $ sudo make install\r\n  $ sudo make install_gui\r\n  $ sudo make install_doc\r\n3) It will be helpful if you download the source code of the kernel that is running on your laptop\r\n4) Having the debug info of that kernel can also be useful\r\n\r\nNote, 3 and 4 above are helpful but not required.",

Using this pocket-sized device, researchers have been able to sequence DNA in the jungle, at the bottom of the ocean, in Antarctica, and on board the International Space Station.\r\n\r\nFor LCA, the challenge will be to prepare, sequence, and analyse a sample of DNA over the course of single talk, with no external power source (apart from the laptop battery), and using freely available software and DNA sequence databases.

This landscape is continually changing in both the types of attacks and the required mitigations. While the last decade saw buffer overflows as a primary source of attacks, Return Oriented Programming (ROP) and Blind Return Oriented Programming (BROP) attacks pose new threats.\r\n\r\nOver the last 20+ years, OpenBSD has essentially been a research and development playground that has designed and implemented such mitigations, in both the kernel and userspace. Many of these mitigations have made their way into other platforms, including Linux, Microsoft Windows, iOS and Android. This talk will look at various long standing mitigations such as W^X and Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR), before moving on to more recent developments such as pledge, unveil, KARL, trapsleds, retguard and MAP_STACK.",

      "abstract": "The OBD-II [1] interface on automobiles today provides access to a rich set of real time vehicle drive data using a pluggable device [2, 3], such as speed, acceleration, braking, GPS co-ordinates, miles driven, fuel consumption, part wear and tear, just to name a few.  Imagine what you can do for fun or profit, possibly launch a service to locate your car in a large parking lot, to track your, nay teenager\u2019s, driving habits, help city planning make driving safer, deploy a driving-based insurance discount program, manage a fleet of vehicles, or provide consumer report style feedback/assessment on early stage autonomous vehicles such as number of times and circumstances under which human intervention was necessary.\r\n\r\nLet us take a closer look at three classes of applications requiring different data handling, both with respect to privacy and volume, and how we might support them. Consider for the first application, Driver-Profile, an insurance style application, where the aggregation service in the cloud requires tracking vehicle-ID, driver-ID, miles driven, speed, acceleration, hard breaking, and areas driven among other things. A second application, Smart-City, that wants to identify traffic bottlenecks and danger zones in various city limits, identified by regions where a vehicle crawls or the driver needed to slam the brakes. For the third application, Car-Profile, the goal is to identify which cars, manufacturer plus model, is involved in the most speeding incidences.  Within the above contexts we demonstrate data extraction, manipulation (masking, dropping, classifying), and transmission (periodically or in aggregate) to various end-points.  We shall implement these in the car, aka edge, using the Function-as-a-Service [4] construct. At the data center, based on the service, additional data sources will be combined to obtain the desired insights. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we bring Automotive IoT to the forefront, demonstrating how Linux on the device/ edge, along intermediate points up into the data center/cloud work together to create a platform to deliver new services to enrich our lives. In true open source style, we shall share the code, to jump start further explorations.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics \r\n2. https://www.moj.io \r\n3. http://zubie.com\r\n4. https://www.openfaas.com/",

The poor locality has a strong impact on the performance of both the kernel and applications. However, understanding kernel cache behavior is not easy because system calls are fast and run in the context of the user process.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents a high frequency profiler called SHIM-PT that can help developers to understand the relationship between the code and kernel cache usage by correlating CPU performance counters with instruction flows of system calls on modern CPUs.\r\n\r\nSHIM-PT uses the SHIM profiler to record micro-architecture behavior by sampling performance counters at a high frequency. At the same time, it records instruction traces of system calls with the Simple-PT tracer. Then SHIM-PT correlates the two signals and reports the cache usage.\r\n\r\nWith Kafka as the workload, we show the importance of kernel performance, the cache usage of system calls and root causes of poor cache locality.",

      "abstract": "Most IoT (The Internet of Things) devices remain under the control of the companies that manufacture them, yielding a plethora of security, privacy and software freedom concerns. Ironically, most such devices include Linux as their base operating system, and Linux's license, GPLv2, mandates the users' rights to modify and upgrade the software. Sadly, due to widespread violations of the GPL, such rights are rarely granted with most IoT devices on the market. This talk explains the political, social, and legal backstory that led to this abysmal situation, and proposes what we must do next to ameliorate the problem.\r\n\r\nIoT (The Internet of Things) is a marketing push by device manufacturers seeking to convince the general public to fill their home with interconnected computers embedded inside commonplace contraptions and tools. Proponents ballyhoo the IoT revolution as bringing the ultimate in convenience and informational interconnectivity for everyone.\r\n\r\nHowever, these embedded devices typically remain under the complete control of the manufacturer \u2014 not only for their basic functionality \u2014 but for safety and security updates as well. In many cases, these devices require Herculean efforts by the home user to modify and upgrade.\r\n\r\nMost ironically, however, nearly all these devices run Linux, which is released under a modification-respecting license, the GNU General Public License, version 2 (GPLv2). The GPLv2 uses copyright controls to mandate the users' ability to modify and upgrade the software. Yet, due to widespread GPL violations throughout the industry, rarely do IoT devices come with the freedoms and rights that GPL tries to uphold.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explain the political, social, and legal ramifications of this abysmal situation. Attendees can expect a full explanation of the history of GPL enforcement, how it has historically defended the rights of hobbyist modifications to home devices, and what processes exist now to continue that fight. In particular, the talk will explain why community-oriented and led GPL compliance efforts are absolutely essential in preventing one of our greatest community-organized technological successes \u2014 namely, the development of Linux \u2014 from becoming part of a dystopia of corporate control in IoT.",

From how we represent colours in black and white to create soft tones, vivid colours of landscapes, to the accurate reproductions for analysis. \r\n\r\nModern digital cameras have a detailed and extensive assortment of colour tools internally. From correcting for lens defects and distortions, to compensating for sensor design, there is a huge amount of stored knowledge in the camera bodies we own. How can we access and understand these? How is this knowledge built? And how can we manipulate and improve colour in our open source tools for photography?\r\n\r\nWilliam will explore the history of colour in photography, detail how cameras reproduce colours, and demonstrate ideas, tools and techniques for colour effects in the open source photo editor darktable - a non-destructive and extensive professional photo editing tool for photographers.",

Reliability of kdump has always been a concern as it suffers from many possible failure modes -- rogue DMA, bad device state at the time of crash, dump capture kernel corruption, etc. Kdump, therefore, works on a best effort basis.\r\n\r\nThe IBM POWER9 processor has a number of satellite processors called PowerPC Processing Elements (PPEs) -- micro-controllers based on a scaled down version of embedded PowerPC processor. PPEs perform various boot and run-time activities for the normal working of the system. One of these PPEs is the Self-Boot Engine (SBE) which plays a significant part in the early boot of the Power processor.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we detail the concept, design, implementation and learning, from a framework that allows for guaranteed capture of the memory state of both the crashed Linux kernel and the OPAL firmware it runs on. On receipt of an indication that the OS/Firmware has crashed, the SBE triggers a memory preserving boot. It then passes control to the early boot firmware which then captures both the OPAL firmware and Linux kernel crash dumps. OPAL firmware then works in conjunction with Linux to extract this dump. Linux then formats the dumps appropriately so that existing analysis tools (crash/gdb) can be used on them. All the components involved to produce the dumps are Open Source. \r\n\r\nWe present various scenarios of software failure and how this framework is designed to work in all such cases, making this solution more robust than the standard kdump.",

      "abstract": "There was a time when I thought that Linux-kernel RCU was so low level that it was immune to security exploits. However, the 2014 advent of Rowhammer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer) put paid to that naive thought.  After all, if the black hats can hit the DRAM, they can surely hit RCU!  And in early 2018, an RCU-related CVE duly appeared.  Now, RCU was operating as advertised, but it had a usability bug which lured a developer into mixing RCU flavors, which has about the same effect on your kernel's actuarial statistics as would acquiring the wrong lock.  So yes, usability bugs are real, so much so that they can result in security exploits!  Who knew?  Linus therefore asked if I could prevent future such exploits by consolidating the three RCU flavors (RCU-bh, RCU-preempt, and RCU-sched) into one flavor to rule them all.     This talk will briefly cover this consolidation, highlighting a few war stories and lessons (re)learned along the way.",

      "abstract": "This is a no-brainer, right? Everyone is just doing mobile apps these days, anyway. So why is this even a talk? Well, imagine you have a desktop application. And that there are good reasons why this should be a desktop application (screen size and ability to talk to random hardware devices, for example). But your users really want a mobile app. And now you need both. And you don't want to throw away all that code. So what do you do?\r\n\r\nThe Subsurface developers decided to build their desktop and mobile apps from the same code base, using QML and Kirigami to develop the mobile flavor of their Qt app. This solved many problems and opened many doors for us, but it also taught us some harsh lessons about being earlier adopters (this was the first Kirigami app outside their own example apps) and niche users of a technology: to this day I believe we are the only Kirigami app that's both in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, and the total number of Qt/QML based applications in both stores is miniscule. Android and iOS packaging are definitely not first class citizens and random other things for those two platforms will randomly not quite work the way you expect.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will briefly touch on the why (as in: why the heck did you do that instead of writing native Java / objC apps?) and then focus on the how: How can you share most of your code between desktop and mobile, make reasonable trade-offs between functionality, and deal with the challenges of supporting Android and iOS (let alone Linux, Mac, and Windows) from the same code base.",

      "abstract": "A trending theme in the Industry 4.0 discourse is that robots and other forms of artificial intelligence are going to take away our jobs. Such predictions are then often accompanied by dystopic scenery of humans commanded by anthropomorphic machines, painting a bleak future for humanity. It goes without doubt that the fourth industrial revolution will effect change upon society, in some ways similar to its three predecessors, and in others different in ways we cannot yet imagine.\r\n\r\nHowever, the robots are not going to replace us, for humans have distinguishing traits, some of which are rooted in millions of years of evolution, and others directly resulting from the way humans interact with their surroundings. While we're likely to see the end of certain lines of work, just like today nobody works shoveling coal on trains, or operating the telephone for others, we will not only adapt to change, but we will be the ones leading it.\r\n\r\nBig data and data science have given us machines capable of identifying correlations in data that were previously invisible to and unfathomable by humans. In what ways can these be considered intelligent? What's missing, and where are the boundaries? Can these be crossed? Ever? Where are the potentials, and how do we better deal with machines making decisions that affect our lives? What are the benefits of asking these questions?\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I explore the nature of intelligence, and what makes humans unique, and robots less so. I would like to take the audience on a \"tour de force\" of 40 years of \"New AI\" research, which I studied and lectured at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Zurich, one of the leading laboratories in this field.\r\n\r\nMy goal is not just to ask questions, or provide simple answers. There are none. Instead, I would like to empower and invite the audience to reframe the debate about artificial intelligence and robots, especially pertaining to the future of work. Progress in the field is accelerating, and we need to shift perspective and ask ourselves: \"what do we want from the robots?\", rather than \"what are they going to do to us?\". Our frame of this debate will inform the way we think about AI and robots, and affect the decisions we make, individually, and as society, about the roles of robots and humans, the potentials of automation, and the ethical and moral challenges associated with the revolution dawning upon us.",

Traditionally, the scientific research community runs these simulations using standard desktops.\r\n\r\nWhen the simulations need to be done at scale (ie: wide-area, or landscape scale), detailed quantitative soil information is not always available. This leads to generalisations and simplifications, which may affect the resulting estimates in ways unknown. However, when there is detailed information, the compute capacity required to analyse that data grows beyond what a standard desktop can handle within the average human lifespan.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share our experiences creating a new data processing pipeline using software containers (Docker and Singularity), that allows processing of vast amounts of high-resolution soil and weather data in a scalable way. This system has already been used in a case study to simulate productivity and environmental aspects of a multi-year crop rotation system across a catchment in the Hawke\u2019s Bay region of New Zealand, at a 5 arc-min grid-cell resolution (~5 km grid size).",

      "abstract": "Clockwork is a programming tool designed to make programming things easier. It provides a simple way to describe the parts of a complicated system and it comes with tools to help get the model right and present information and controls in a user-friendly way. Clockwork programs are interconnected parts, called 'machines' that monitor each other and make sure the whole system performs as required.\r\n In our presentation, we will show examples of programming `things` and talk about what to do when the programming gets tough. We start with some simple programs that read data from a sensor and use that data to control a small device while also providing an IoT interface to monitor the process. We show these programs using common C/Python tools and also demonstrate how to do the same things with our Clockwork language and tools.\r\nFor some years we have been building a set of open source tools for industrial control, based around a language we call Clockwork. It is now possible to compile Clockwork code so it can run on a broad range of devices, from tiny 8-bit Atmel-based Arduinos, small Espressif ESP32 devices, to Linux hardware such as the Beaglebone black. This means that it is now much easier to go a lot further when programming things, without needing to worry too much about writing time-consuming and often quite involved thread stuff.\r\nThe secret to keeping things simple is to make the components independent so they can run along happily without concern for other parts of the system. In Clockwork, this is done by describing models of the system we want to control or monitor in terms of its states (e.g. hot, cold, on, off, rising, falling, and so on). We think that the model-building approach makes it easier for programmers to achieve more, especially where the system being controlled involves many interacting parts that need to be controlled in parallel and in real time. Accomplished programmers will enjoy programming with the Clockwork tools especially for complex systems and new programmers will enjoy being able to get further with less debugger time. We think that its main benefit is simplifying the process of building complete systems, enabling construction by describing what a system should do rather than how it must do it.\r\nThere are many exciting features about the clockwork language, including: internal or external monitoring of state changes, comprehensive debugging that tracks the state components are in and how they got there, and the ability to display everything on a webpage -and don't we all simply love that!",

Much of what has been implemented is obviously valuable, but sometimes the benefit is more subtle. How does the introduction of refcount_t make the kernel more secure, and by how much? What value is there in removing variable length arrays? Casey Schaufler, a (really) long time kernel developer will explain why some of these changes provide significantly greater value than might be apparent to the casual observer. He will discuss the cost of kernel hardening in terms of development overhead, code churn and performance.",

Uber also developed software (called 'greyball') which allowed them to cheat law enforcement officials trying to crack down on ride-sharing. The difference is that Volkswagen software engineers went to jail, and Uber software engineers didn't. Why? Because one is a car company, and one is a software company.\r\n\r\nMost industries have had what we might call an \"oh no\" moment. It's those moments that encourage industries to become better regulated, in order to prevent further disasters. The IT industry has had many moments that could be considered consequential enough to encourage better regulation, but the changes have never been made. Because the industry has avoided effective regulation for so long, it is possible that we are hurtling towards a disaster of epic proportions, one that we haven't even managed to conceive of yet.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will go through some historical examples of disasters leading to regulation in other industries, and the measures that were put into place to mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the major moments from the IT industry that should have prompted regulation, and haven't. Finally, I will discuss ways that IT professionals can blow the whistle on potential disasters before they happen ... without losing your job!",

Over recent users we've seen vulnerabilities involving exploitation of code running in system management mode, taking advantage of firmware-level hardware initialisation scripts run on resume from suspend, and even compromise of the management engine - an entirely separate computer that lives inside your chipset.\r\n\r\nThere's a huge amount of work being done to improve this, but you probably haven't heard about it. This presentation will cover how the state of the art is shifting, along with a discussion of how much of this applies to projects such as Coreboot and Libreboot and whether it's possible to obtain the same level of security without compromising the freedom to run whatever you want on your system.",

Faucet controls OpenFlow 1.3 hardware which delivers high forwarding performance.\r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate how we recently used faucet to deploy a large 100G network for an HPC conference. We will present how faucet works, our network design and an evaluation of the benefits of our approach. For this deployment we were able to greatly simplify the network and replaced many thousands of lines of vendor-specific configuration with a single easy to understand YAML configuration file. Faucet allows users to avoid vendor lock-in in a unique way by implementing the network as specified by the faucet configuration in hardware using the OpenFlow protocol. In this case we demonstrate the control of devices from three different vendors.",

While, concepts in quantum computing have been around for over 30 years, but it hasn't been generally accessible until recently. Despite this quantum computing is still very much in its infancy and there are physical limitations preventing them from being generally usable. But the machines that are available today are useful for experimentation and showcasing certain applications where they will be useful. \r\n\r\nOpen source software for quantum computing has started being developed as these new machines are being built. Learning the lessons from the history of developing classical computers, there are already several open source SDKs, languages, and libraries being developed despite for quantum computers despite the current limitations of quantum computers. This means as the technology matures and becomes more practical there will already be an open source ecosystem for using quantum computing.\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide an introduction to the basics of quantum information theory, look at some of the quantum computers out there, explore the open source tooling available for quantum computing, and show how you can use that to write your own quantum programs and run them on simulators and actual quantum computers.",

Many wireless development boards (even the ones with built in battery chargers) are actually not well suited to ultra-low-power applications.\r\n\r\nBeing truly wireless means (shock) no wires, not even for power. So we rely on battery, and perhaps solar. This brings a host of challenges: selecting the right battery, avoiding power-hungry components, coping with the limitations of a low-power radio platform like LoRa, learning the intricacies of deep-sleep modes, and choosing and using solar cells.\r\n\r\nThis is a case-study and lessons-learned from a real project for IoT utility metering. What seemed like a simple problem led to a deep dive into ultra-low-power subsystems of modern IoT processors, and the practicalities of the LoRa radio platform.",

      "abstract": "In the beginning, the motivation for developing and using Free Software centered on a shared value of enabling and maintaining end user freedom.  As more and more developers joined Free and Open Source Software communities and software innovation moved largely to openly collaborative spaces, the economic benefits for companies of using FOSS technology became immense.  Not surprisingly, this has led us to an era where we talk more about benefits than core FOSS values, which unfortunately can lead us to make choices that aren't good long-term bets!\r\n\r\nThe immense growth and success of FOSS has led to a world in which virtually every computing device on the planet contains at least some open source component.  But even today, many companies fear deeply engaging in the collaborative development model, insisting instead on licences and governance terms for the FOSS projects they interact with that allow them to be pure consumers of innovation.\r\n\r\nThis talk will review the economics of collaboration, and the related essentials of FOSS project longevity, illuminating the difference between consumptive and fully engaged participation.  The session will conclude with concrete suggestions on how to maximize the value of participation in FOSS for users, developers, and corporate decision makers... and why the best bet may be to go all-in!",

      "abstract": "TL;DR: come learn how going back to the days of smaller CPUs is interesting, fun, and can be useful for many applications. \r\nWhat you can expect to learn outside of the fun factor and the rewarding learning experiences:\r\n- get an overview of what you can learn and do beyond what's mentioned in your basic arduino book\r\n- some of the joys of reliving what the pioneers who built computers and drivers in the Steve Wozniak days, went through, despite how much easier it is today\r\n- how that new knowledge can be applied to various real projects like a fancy lit shirt, not losing a multi thousand dollar RC plane, or helping test new hardware at work\r\n- how despite how shiny your hammer is, not everything is a nail: where I haven't used microcontrollers, and why.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nLet's face it, computers have become entirely too boring. You use high level languages, some even keep track of your memory and try to stop you from writing bugs. You have more cores, more Mhz, and more memory than you know what to do with.\r\n- Has your life has started losing meaning as a result?\r\n- Are you not sure how many bits are in a byte?\r\n- Are you tired that you haven't had to deal with compiler induced bugs in too long (if ever)? Or you don't ever use compilers?\r\n- Is it boring that someone has already written the drivers for the hardware in your computer?\r\n- wouldn't it be more fun to write single threaded code without an OS then a boring small application on a computer that runs hundreds more at the same time?\r\n- Do you regret never having to pull a voltmeter or logic analyser to debug your code?\r\n\r\nFear no more: Jon Oxner and his team have been offering an open hardware miniconf at LCA since 2010, which will bring you back to the days where computers were hard, and you earned it :)\r\n\r\nThanks to Jon and his team-mates, I got into arduino and other open hardware microcontrollers in 2011. This talk will give you a taste of what I was able to learn as a result, and what you can learn too:\r\n- Once past the basic I/O on arduinos, I got to write a callback based color LED changer. Learn why callback programming is harder and yet important.\r\n- To go several notches up, I wrote a interrupt driven tricolor matrix line scan driver with Adafruit::GFX support. Learn about actual interrupt programming and GCC's volatile\r\n- I had to write a LiquidCrystal Text LCD driver for OHMC's Pebble V2 project. Learn about pulling out a data sheet and comparing it with your board's wiring.\r\n- Because I didn't learn my lesson, I ended up writing 5 different drivers for the 2017 OHMC IoTuz ESP32 based board. On that one, you'll learn that you should wait for another sucker to do the work :)\r\n\r\nBut you shouldn't just learn to program open hardware on LCA Open Hardware MiniConf boards for fun, it will come in handy later:\r\n- After losing a multi thousand dollar Ardupilot based plane I built to a motor failure in flight, I was able to modify the arduino based On Screen Display board to detect future motor failures and flash them on screen\r\n- I felt shy and without friends at parties, as well as too dark at burning man, so I made nice ESP8266 controlled shirt and pants with my own patterns\r\n- then I went overboard and added 1536 LEDs in 2 panels, one front, one back on my 2nd version of the shirt\r\n- And because a 768 LED matrix wasn't big enough, I got suckered into building a 4096 LED one soon thereafter. Great for burning man, though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH1rhg3PRgk\r\n- At work, I help with testing of our new hardware with the Fuchsia operating system, which requires remotely controlling dev boards, to reboot them when they are crashed, or other simple things like hitting GPIOs if needed, or potentially emulating a keyboard, a mouse, or even a USB boot device with a new OS image.\r\n- As a counterpoint, I'll also go into microcontroller uses I haven't done, and why.\r\n\r\nI will go into this list of examples, how they were fun, useful, or both, and hopefully encourage you to do the same.",

On your laptop you will be configuring a virtual network topology using Open vSwitch as a switch and network namespaces as hosts. This network will be controlled via the OpenFlow protocol by a faucet controller. We will investigate many different Faucet features such as VLANs, ACLs, Routing, etc. The network we configure will be monitored by Prometheus (over OpenFlow not SNMP) and we will make some dashboards in Grafana to view the performance data stored in Prometheus.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of flexibility in the tutorial to accommodate both beginners as well as advanced users to the world of SDN. \r\n\r\nWhat is Faucet? It is a compact open source OpenFlow controller, which enables network operators to run their networks the same way they do server clusters. Faucet moves network control functions (like routing protocols, neighbor discovery, and switching algorithms) to vendor independent server-based software, versus traditional router or switch embedded firmware, where those functions are easy to manage, test, and extend with modern systems management best practices and tools. Faucet controls OpenFlow 1.3 hardware which delivers high forwarding performance.",

      "abstract": "Motivation\r\nMRI is a powerful medical device beyond the reach of many patients throughout the world. Open source imaging initiative (OSI\u00b2) aims to address this issue collaboratively by facilitating the sharing of research around MRI technology and building an affordable open source MRI scanner. Here we present the roadmap of OSI\u00b2 which extends into six different areas:\r\n1.\tOpen Source Hardware and Software Development\r\n2.\tGuidelines for Open Source Research and Development\r\n3.\tCommunity Building\r\n4.\tQuality, Reliability and Safety\r\n5.\tEducation\r\n6.\tBusinesses and Distribution\r\n\r\nOpen Source Hardware and Software Development\r\nSimilar to OS complex software projects, our hardware development follows a modular approach. This will allow independent developments, as well as reproducible and exchangeable components. We are developing a complete MRI prototype for the extremities. Our efforts are, however, not limited to this initial system. We encourage the community to develop and exchange alternative approaches. \r\n\r\nGuidelines for Open Source Research and Development\r\nTransparency should be a must in science. Providing open source software and hardware documentation along with a scientific publication accelerates the reproducibility of scientific advancements, facilitates the validation of findings, and rewards authors with visibility. We encourage researchers to publish in journals that promote OS software/hardware publications.\r\n\r\nCommunity Building\r\nWe are implementing open communication channels for software/hardware and general discussions to stimulate participation and to collaboratively shape and move towards our vision.\r\n\r\nQuality, Reliability and Safety\r\nQuality, reliability and safety of medical devices is typically assured through the oversight of government-based organisations. We want to create guidelines that will allow a smooth transition from research prototypes to medical devices. These guidelines will also help developers in countries, where the requirements for device safety may be arbitrary or nonexistent. We are collaborating with OpenQRS in a long-term vision to implement open data systems to inform the users and the public about the quality, reliability and safety of healthcare devices to ensure and improve patient safety.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nEducation stands on transparency. Providing the widest possible access to documentation, manuals, data, and source code fosters the training of users and developers. We highly encourage developers to go the extra mile and document their work openly, which will provide easy global access to knowledge for students, researchers, and developers.\r\n\r\nBusinesses and Distribution\r\nAlthough OSI\u00b2 is a not-for-profit movement, business partners will be important to boost global access to MRI systems and ensure their quality. OS R&D of MRI hardware has the potential to lower investment/service costs, create local markets with stable low prices, and encourage device customisation. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThrough transparent collaboration we hope to improve global access to affordable and high-quality MRI devices, which could lay the groundwork for development of other medical devices. Please visit www.opensourceimaging.org or contact us at info@opensourceimaging.org to contribute and help us make this vision a reality.",

      "abstract": "Lawful intercept (LI) obligations for Internet service providers have changed significantly in the past few years. Whereas law enforcement agencies were previously willing to accept a simple pcap trace of customer traffic (typically delivered some number of hours or days of delay) for the requested time period as a valid intercept, new standards for LI, such as the ETSI LI standards, are much more onerous for operators to comply with. Specifically, intercepted traffic must be delivered to the agencies in real time, encapsulated within LI-specific headers and delivered alongside additional meta-data records that describe how and when the target was interacting with the operator's infrastructure (i.e. RADIUS servers, SIP servers, etc.).\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, all Internet service providers that have at least 4000 subscribers must be capable of delivering an ETSI-compliant intercept (live-streamed) upon receipt of a warrant from a law enforcement agency. Many hardware vendors offer licenses that will enable LI capabilities in their devices, but the cost of these licenses is extremely high. This creates a problem for smaller network operators: how can they meet their LI obligations without bankrupting themselves on vendor licenses?\r\n\r\nThe OpenLI project is a collaboration between the WAND Network Research Group at the University of Waikato and a group of New Zealand network operators aimed at providing an alternative (and much cheaper) way for operators to meet their lawful intercept requirements as defined in New Zealand law. WAND provides the experience and programming expertise to develop an ETSI-compliant software solution that can be used by the operators to meet their LI obligations. In turn, the operators each contribute a relatively small sum of money to cover the cost of the programmer's time and provide access to realistic deployment environments and traffic workloads for testing. The eventual finished software will be released as open-source under a GPL license.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover a number of relevant topics, including:\r\n * The ETSI LI standards and why pcaps aren't good enough anymore.\r\n * The LI landscape in New Zealand specifically and how it led to OpenLI being started.\r\n * Why hasn't anyone tried to solve LI with OSS before?\r\n * Overview of other OSS that OpenLI is built upon.\r\n * Design and structure of the OpenLI software.\r\n * Interesting anecdotes about tricky problems we've had so far and how we've solved them.\r\n * Where the project is at right now.\r\n * What you can do to help out, if you are that way inclined.",

At every layer of software from wifi modem micro-code to web backgammon there are passwords, updates and restrictions that get in the way of doing the simple things we set out to accomplish. If you\u2019re a developer, it\u2019s even worse with CVE tracking, code scanners and named exploits sucking away precious schedule time. But what if it wasn\u2019t that way? What would software be like if someone developed computer security with the explicit goal of creating something people will like? Casey Schaufler knows how dreadful the experience of security can be, having implemented everything from access control lists and release process to the ugliest login screen ever produced. In this talk he steps back from the traditional approach to computer security and investigates it from the viewpoint of providing a delightful user experience. The talk starts off with the basic premises of security and why they ought to make systems more usable, not less. It continues with the importance of creating security models that reflect what people want the software to do, and how to go about doing so. The process of building software to enforce those models and the mechanism for ensuring that both security and user experience are maintained throughout are described. Finally, the problem of keeping the user experience from deteriorating when faced with new and unexpected security challenges is addressed.",

In today's world of 'learn to code in 6 weeks' courses and programmes that teach high-level languages in the first month, we are in danger of the widening gap between an abstract and fundamental understanding of machines. I put forward the case that we should start training young engineers at the lowest possible level (assembly language) - not because it is necessarily useful of itself, but because of the deep understanding and efficiency learned from such a low level approach. There is a saying in Wing Tsun Kung Fu - 'If you can't do it slow, you can't do it fast.' - I propose that something similar is true in software; if one does not develop a deep understanding of the fundamentals of machine architecture and programming at the chip level, one is less likely to be able to meet the challenges of the modern age; that learning the lowest level possible teaches lessons that are relevant even when the target architecture has multiple cores, GHz of performance, and Gbs of memory. With our recent focus on IoT, an 'old-skool' approach is especially relevant given IoT and embedded devices, which possess very limited capabilities by comparison.",

      "abstract": "Modern smart-phones are untrustable.  Even if they were open-source, the sheer complexity makes them impossible to meaningfully verify, and therefore trust them.  Worse, because they contain major closed-source elements, we lack the digital sovereignty to even attempt such a verification.  These concerns are not merely theoretical, the Samsung Galaxy S2 back-door episode, as well as Spectre and Meltdown, and the surveillance facilities purposely built into the cellular network are all evidence that verifyability, trustability, and ultimately, digital sovereignty are all sorely wanted.\r\n\r\nPast efforts to make open-source smart-phones have struggled on a number of fronts.  First, the chipsets are rarely open-source friendly.  Second, even if you find a suitable chipset, by the time you go to market, it is likely already obsolete, and the process of migrating to new chipsets every year is not sustainable for an open-source project. Third, even if you do succeed, there are enough closed-source blobs to make the whole thing untrustable, and without the user holding sovereignty over the device.\r\n\r\nWe have thus taken a fresh approach to this problem, and created a smart-phone like device that uses an FPGA as the main application processor, and coupled it with an industry standard mini-PCIe cellular modem. The result is a system where you can freely upgrade the cellular modem using commercial off-the-shelf modules, and have complete sovereignty, in that you can create your own FPGA bitstream that defines whatever application processor you want. The cellular modem is left as an untrusted and quarantined \"black box\".  Importantly, the microphone connects to the modem via the FPGA, so it is possible to prevent the cellular modem listening in when it shouldn't be.  Indeed, we have gone two steps further: You can cut the power to the modem, or even physically remove it.  This modular approach also leaves the door open for a truly open cellular modem to be created, without making us wait in the meantime.\r\n\r\nAs FPGA programming is not for everyone, and because the device should be fun, and because it is easier to make a less miniaturised device on a shoe-string budget, we are creating prototype devices that double as a portable game console, similar in size to a 3DS XL, and that implements both basic telephony (voice, SMS, contacts) and is backwards compatible with the Commodore 64:  The core telephony software we have created is written using an extension to Commodore 64 BASIC, and is already open-sourced, and small enough for a determined user to verify.  Naturally, you can use the tune from your favourite C64 game or demo as ringtone and/or hold music, and play your favourite games while on a call.  Thanks to our crazy full-crossbar audio mixer framework, you can even have the sound from what you are playing audible to you, but not to the other party. And because of our history with the Serval Project, we are also including some long-range UHF packet radios for good measure.\r\n\r\nThe resulting franken-phone will not be for everyone, but we believe it represents a significant milestone, in that it could well be the first long-term sustainable open-source smart-phone, and perhaps the first ever smart-phone to offer true digital sovereignty. And play Impossible Mission.\r\n\r\n\"Telephone Tennis\" can finally be a game you can enjoy.",

      "abstract": "Positioning technology is now ubiquitous. This technology was originally restricted to the military and commercial transport, it is now being built into everyday products such as cars, cell phones and watches.\r\n\r\nA brief overview of the three GPS segments will be introduced - Control Segment, Space Segment, User Segment, detailing how each of these cooperate to provide the user's location in both space and time. Methods will be covered that allow the receiver to acquire the civilian Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) satellite signal, track the signal until a solid lock is obtained, allowing the reception and decoding the down-link navigation data. \r\n\r\nA demonstration of technique will be performed by decoding previously acquired Radio-Frequency data. This is a level of detail usually hidden from the everyday GPS user and not normally seen, and will illustrate such concepts as the difference between a cold and warm start, the almanac, time to first fix and number of active channels. \r\n\r\nInexpensively GPS hardware receivers are available from many suppliers, including hobby stores like Jaycar, commercial suppliers, and internet retailers such as Ali Express. As with all areas of technology, GPS receivers have their own jagon - understanding these is important selecting an appropriate module for a project. A few different inexpensive GPS hardware modules will be reviewed and a Raspberry Pi Zero running Linux will illustrate the low cost and accessibility of the hardware.\r\n\r\nTo communicate with a GPS module the lingua franca of positioning systems is NMEA 0183 sentences, a standard developed by the National Marine Electronics Association. The NMEA data stream will be explained - how to parse them, how to detect data errors, what sorts of information it can provide.\r\n\r\nThe efficient and correct processing of location data is important, and a few techniques will be covered that can be used to handle different use-cases. A brief overview of the Latitude, Longitude, Altitude (LLA) and Earth Centered, Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinate systems will be provided, and followed with examples of how you can compute using GPS data and either a 'flat earth', spherical or WGS 84 ellipsoid model.\r\n\r\nAlthough GPS is a receive-only system it is not without security issues. Various attacks are possible, including shielding, jamming, spoofing, denial of service, hardware interception and (perhaps most interestingly) attacks against GPS receiver firmware. Other issues arise from the wider problem of securing access to GPS information in cloud-based services, and examples of what unexpected information may be revealed.",

      "abstract": "AMP is a distributed network monitoring platform designed to continuously perform active network measurements, capable of monitoring both network and service performance. Currently available tests include ICMP and TCP latency, UDP DNS latency, TCP throughput, HTTP performance and video streaming performance. Scheduled tests run continuously on the probes and report data to a central collector (or into your favourite storage/graphing tool) to generate graphs. The same tests can also be run as standalone tools from the command line as required.\r\n\r\nThere are AMP probes deployed at most universities in New Zealand, at major sites on the REANNZ network, and at many New Zealand Internet Service Providers, all with publicly available data. AMP is also being used internally by a number of ISPs to monitor customer experience and infrastructure performance.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover the architecture and design of the AMP platform, as well as how the tests work, how the data gets reported and some of the issues we've encountered while trying to take accurate measurements. In particular it will show some of the challenges involved in creating a test to measure video streaming performance using a headless web browser. It will also explore some of the data that has been collected over the last few years and showcase some of the more impactful network events, misconfigurations, or generally interesting behaviour that has been observed.",

Citing their wishes for newcomers to experiment with new ideas, and that the future will be shaped by the next generation, they challenged the world to continue maintenance on grsecurity themselves. Left with little more than the previous patch to 4.9.24, and the knowledge that 4.9 will receive back ported fixes from upstream for two years, it was clear that there were large shoes to fill.\r\n\r\nAt the time, I was building my distro, Dapper Linux, and one of its key value propositions is running a grsec kernel out of the box. Feeling left high and dry, and unwilling to give up on the technological advancements that the patchset provides, I decided to learn kernel development, and attempt to maintain the patchset as a complete kernel newbie.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will have a look at the internals of the patchset, and what features are provided, slightly touch on the politics surrounding the patchset (and epic flamewars on the kernel-hardening list). We will also see what I have done to keep the patchset alive, and my attempts to forward port the patchset to newer major kernel versions, as well as the typical maintenance for 4.9 LTS.\r\n\r\nWe will also see how a kernel newbie became the sole maintainer of the patchset in its entirety, and the roadblocks that have arisen that have caused far more experienced developers to give up. Finally, we will talk about what the future holds, once support for 4.9 LTS ends in Jan 2020.",

      "abstract": "We're all convinced that automated tests are a good idea. For some applications (e.g. grep, awk, cc, ...) this is very straightforward. Others are a lot harder to test, for example firewalls. \r\nTypically testing firewalls takes two to three hosts. One to send traffic, the firewall test host and one to receive traffic. This makes automated test orchestration complex and brittle. This in turn means that tests either don't get written, are difficult to write and/or suffer random failures unrelated to issues in the firewall itself. Virtualisation has made this all somewhat easier, but it's still fiddly and difficult to make robust. It's also slow.\r\n\r\nThe new FreeBSD network stack virtualisation lets us build on the existing jails system to build test setups, execute tests and clean up in mere seconds, without any requirement for additional hardware, or even hardware virtualisation support.",

Fast-forward to the end of 2018, Stephen has stepped back from site cleaning and has joined the Wordfence team full time as a developer, so now it's time for him to tell his story. In this talk he will share stories from the more memorable sites he cleaned (names changed to protect the innocent), including revealing his all-time favorite WP malware, and the epic tale of the persistent attacker that almost thwarted the Wordfence team completely. Scattered throughout will be tips and ideas to help protect your site from compromise and keep everyone (except the bad guys!) happy.",

But while attractive, this technology is currently used to gather data, using spoken utterances to personalize advertisements, and provide privacy-impugning \u2018nudges. Enter open source, privacy-focussed voice assistants. As voice becomes ubiquitous, those organisations wanting to ensure privacy and prevent vendor lock-in are turning to open source solutions.What's out there? What are the differences? And what sort of things should you consider when you're choosing an open source voice platform? What does the open source voice assistant roadmap look like? What models are there for sustainability and revenue generation in open source voice? This presentation will provide an overview of the voice stack, and the different open source options available at each layer of the stack, as well as their pros and cons, enabling you to make an informed choice about open source voice.",

These technologies have had their strengths and weaknesses but overall we have found that Clockwork and its associated tools has far greater re-usability and lower per-machine development overhead than anything else we have tried.

      "abstract": "Professional skill-building is challenging, particularly when the skill to acquire is about distributed, scalable platform technology. In this talk, I cover an open-source skill-building platform that is 100% Python: built on Open edX and heavily involving Django, Ansible, and OpenStack.\r\n\r\nThe information technology industry is currently dealing with an interesting challenge in professional skill-building: almost every new technology developed in recent years has been complex, distributed, and built for scale: Kubernetes, Ceph, and OpenStack can serve as just a few representative examples. Loose coupling, asynchronicity, and elasticity are just some of the qualities frequently found in such systems that were entirely absent in many of the systems we built only a few years ago. As a result, people comfortable with building and operating these complex systems are hardly found in abundance, and organisations frequently struggle to adopt these technologies as a direct result of this scarcity: we are dealing with a skills gap, not a technology gap.\r\n\r\nThis means that we need novel ways to educate professionals on these technologies. We must provide professional learners with complex, distributed systems to use as realistic learning environments, and we must enable them to learn from anywhere, at any time, and on their own pace. One excellent way of doing this is to use the capabilities of the Open edX platform to integrate a learning management system with hands-on, on-demand lab environments that can be just as complex, and just as distributed, as production systems. This allows anyone interested to develop a professional skill set on novel technology at minimal cost, and without the need for costly hardware platforms for evaluation.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will give a rapid technical introduction to the core components of this free and open source (AGPL 3/ASL 2) all-Python platform:\r\n\r\n* edx-platform, the core learning management system (LMS) and content management system (CMS), built on Django;\r\n* edx-configuration, the automated deployment facility to roll out the Open edX platform, built on Ansible;\r\n* and finally, the Open edX XBlock extension system and its integration with OpenStack, also itself an all-Python cloud platform, in order to provide on-demand lab environments from both private and public cloud environments.",

The ARM926EJ-S ARM processor made its appearance as the embedded CPU in Transcend\u2019s WiFi-enabled SD cards, clocking in at an impressive 426 BogoMips \u2013 we can\u2019t possibly leave that territory unexplored, can we?\r\n\r\nIn this session we root the card\u2019s own CPU, install a more featureful OS, and explore the system\u2019s common and unusual capabilities (in hardware AES encryption and native support for Java bytecode among them). These provide plenty of building blocks for our projects.\r\n\r\nI will review the hardware, its capabilities, how to breach its security, and how to enable it with top-class network configuration at boot-up, on nearly any network. I will then show how to build and install additional software and customize the device, using shell script and Perl, for workloads that fit its minute size and low power requirements.\r\n\r\nClearly, complete control of such a hidden computer running with full network connectivity can be used in network penetration scenarios. We\u2019ll discuss applicable security threat countermeasures.\r\n\r\nWe close the session with a review of similar exploits against hard drive controllers. There is plenty of room at the bottom, and opening these computer-within-the computer configurations create interesting miniaturized automation scenarios alongside the obvious, more ominous security aspects.\r\n\r\nUse your newfound knowledge for good, with great power comes great responsibility!",

Soon afterwards, work began on fixing the problems--work that lasted around 4 years and resulted in the release of cgroups v2 in 2016. Even then, much work remained to be done, with the absence of some important features blocking widespread adoption of cgroups v2. One of the main logjams was finally broken at the beginning of 2018 with the merging of the cgroups v2 CPU controller, and it seems likely that the remaining missing pieces will be added in the next few kernel releases. It seems likely that cgroups v2 will become more widely used in the not too distant future. (One of the notable users of cgroups v1, systemd, is already migrating to cgroups v2.)\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll briefly consider some of the problems in cgroups v1 that motivated the cgroups v2 redesign, and then go on to look at the differences and new features in cgroups v2. I'll also look at what pieces are still missing in cgroups v2 and some other possible changes that come to cgroups v2 in the future. Some familiarity with the cgroups mechanism will be assumed.",

Whether you're fighting the common cold, or trying to remove the ILOVEYOU computer worm from your corporate file server, two things are certain: your immune system is based on your gut health, and computers have really poor gut health.\r\n\r\nStopping viruses is hard. The main reason for this is that viruses are really clever. They've evolved over time to escape detection. Each previously detected virus allows the next iteration of the virus to become more resilient. The second reason is that your computer's gut health has to fight every virus, whereas each virus just has to find one immuno-compromised system to survive.\r\n\r\nLet's work out how viruses hide. How to they sneak past the checkpoints. How they attach themselves to your system. How they fight detection, and removal. We'll look at aspects such as self-replication, cryptographic obfuscation, and touch on methods of delivery and infection.\r\n\r\nNow that you're thinking like a virus writer, you can anticipate which areas of your applications need hardening.

Do you understand the tradeoffs that different kinds of load balancing techniques make? If not, this talk is for you.\r\n\r\nLoad balancing is hard, and it is made up of many disparate technologies. It cuts across network, transport and application layers. We'll describe different flavours of load balancing (network, naming, application) and how they work. \r\n\r\nWe will then discuss example use cases, and which load balancing approaches are most appropriate in each case. We'll also relate these to several design patterns for high-availability services that have developed over the years. Finally, we'll relate the techniques we've been discussing to well-known open source technologies and to the major cloud load balancing services.\r\n\r\nYou will come away with:\r\n- An understanding of various load balancing techniques, and some of their high points and pitfalls.\r\n- Some criteria by which to evaluate different load balancing technologies.\r\n- A framework of heuristics to use when deciding what load balancing pattern(s) to use with your service.",

There are countless public kernel testing projects and probably even\r\nmore private ones, with hardware vendors testing what works on their own\r\nmachines and maintainers automating checks for what should go into their trees.\r\nIf you're a developer, you probably don't know about any of this unless someone\r\ndirectly tells you.\r\n\r\nThe granularity of running these tests is similarly all over the place:\r\nmany test environments just look at mainline, many look at linux-next or\r\ntrees of specific maintainers, and some run on every patch, like the Intel\r\n0-day bot.  If you're a developer, unless your patch doesn't compile, you're\r\nprobably not going to hear about it.\r\n\r\nProjects that use pull requests on GitHub as a code submission method have it\r\neasy: a developer sends a PR, some CI system magically tests it, and\r\ndevelopers and maintainers alike can quickly see if the code has issues.\r\nThe value in continuous integration is about quick feedback to the developer,\r\nand saving precious time of reviewers and maintainers.\r\n\r\nThis is where snowpatch comes in, using Patchwork as the publicly visible\r\nplatform for test results on patches.  Tests can come in from anywhere,\r\neven an internal lab of a hardware vendor, and have their results published\r\nfor the world to see within minutes of a patch being sent.  It's the closest\r\nthing we have in the world of mailing lists to the simplicity of the GitHub\r\nworkflow, it's easy to get going, and it can function as decentralised as\r\nthe rest of kernel development.\r\n\r\nWe're going to cover how snowpatch works, why it's useful, what we're doing\r\nwith it currently, and look to the future to determine just how much we could\r\ntell the world about a patch, only minutes after it's been sent.",

This is something that can only happen due to the openness that is inherent in our community. At Monash University, final year undergraduate and masters students are frequently directed to various open source communities to explain high quality examples of both technical and non technical skills. The list is never ending, and includes communicating clearly, documenting requirements, peer reviews, user tests, unit tests, CI/CD, infrastructure management, and many more\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we'll walk through some important skills that may not fit easily into a typical university curriculum, but for which many well run open source communities excel at. We will highlight some key insights that students are able to gleam from open source projects that they would be unable to otherwise achieve.",

This research was presented at the LCA 2015 as Operation Windigo. The modus operandi of this campaign consisted mainly in stealing login credentials through an OpenSSH backdoor called Ebury, allowing them to extend their network of compromised servers. Prior to the installation of the backdoor, operators used a recon script to collect a handful of information, including the presence of other OpenSSH backdoors on the system.\r\nIn 3 years, we collected hundreds of undocumented samples matching the rules based on the signatures we extracted from the script. This talk will present the analysis we made of these samples, from the most basic ones to advanced ones involving exotic encryption algorithms, anti-logging and diverse methods of exfiltration.\r\nIn order to pivot on these findings, we have setup a custom honeypot infrastructure and let the operators behind the backdoors play with it. We will present the checks they make before deploying their malware, how they install it and the lateral movements we observed so far. We will also talk about the new samples we were able to obtain thanks to this poker strike. \r\nFinally, we will give some pointers on preventing this kind of threats and how one can ensure the legitimacy of OpenSSH daemons and clients.",

It currently targets older DOS embedded platforms where both disk space and memory are limited and the notoriously long decode times of Crinkler are unacceptable.  An experimental 32-bit ELF target is in progress which will bring the same executable compression tools to Linux for use in embedded or IOT applications.\r\n\r\nThis talk will describe the PAQ compression algorithm in detail and give a short overview of the assembly code for decompression.  It will provide an overview of how XLINK works and is able to trade-off start-up time for compression by varying the decoder algorithm, including the use of multiple entropy segments and an alternate lower complexity hashing function.  You will learn why applying compression while linking outperforms even the best post-link-stage executable compressors and what extra size-optimization tricks are available at link-time.  Finally, we will look at the open research problems in executable compression and other future work like individual function compression for patching existing binaries.",

Sometimes, it just needs a face lift.\r\n\r\nAgile documentation is, by its very nature, piecemeal, which can make it difficult to maintain a large documentation suite, and almost impossible to perform a large project that requires meticulous planning and extensive testing.
