The core two-day curriculum includes the Unix shell (and how to automate repetitive tasks); Python or R (and how to grow a program in a modular, testable way); Git and GitHub (and how to track and share work efficiently); and SQL (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).     \r\n\r\nWhile the organisation has been around for over a decade, it had a breakout year in 2013.

To kick things off in Australia, the founder of Software Carpentry (Dr. Greg Wilson) visited Sydney and Melbourne in February 2013 to host the first ever bootcamps outside of Europe and North America. Since that visit five local instructors have been trained up and have delivered an additional ten bootcamps around the country.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will review the first year of Software Carpentry activities in Australia, with a particular focus on the key lessons learned in teaching computational best practices to the research community.

Spreadsheets have many advantages - they have a low barrier to entry and are easy for most people to understand.  However as they get more complicated, disadvantages start to appear; in particular, they can be inflexible and highly error-prone.\r\n \r\nIn this talk I will explain how business case analysis can be done using python and pandas.  The python version has several advantages over spreadsheets: it is more flexible as the business structure changes; formulas only need to be changed in a single place, reducing the chance of error; and report-ready plots are quick to produce.  I'll go through a way of structuring the problem for some simple business logic, and ways to visualise the results.\r\n \r\nThe example I\u2019ll discuss is made more interesting and useful by being \u201cMonte Carlo\u201d analysis.

Everybody knows the profit will not turn out to be exactly equal to the forecast.

Understanding, and exploiting, graphical structures creates opportunities for obtaining new analytic insights, implementing new computational paradigms, and better defining the relationship between objects of any sort.\r\n\r\nPython provides access to these graph and network structures using the fantastic NetworkX library (http://networkx.github.io/) .  In this presentation we will give an introduction to the NetworkX library, showing how easy it is to build and exploit simple graphical and network structures.\r\n\r\nFrom that starting point we will then discuss a number of more complicated, real world examples of how the NetworkX library can be used to:\r\n - Analyse social networks to extract valuable information about people / entities within those networks.\r\n - Implement reconfigurable processing pipelines (something we refer to as computational graphs) for data capture, processing and analytics.\r\n - Easily track the relationship between Python objects in a variety of other interesting and useful scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will be targeted at intermediate developers and no prior experience with graphs, networks or NetworkX is required. This presentation will offer an easy introduction to the world of networks and graphs in Python and will illustrate real world uses of this powerful and useful paradigm. \r\n", "start": "2014-08-02 11:15:00", "schedule_id": 29, "url": "http://2014.pycon-au.org/schedule/30008/view_talk", "duration": "0:45:00", "presenters": "Lachlan Blackhall"}, {"end": "2014-08-02 14:00:00", "title": "IPython parallel for distributed computing", "event_id": 37, "abstract": "IPython is becoming a very popular platform for scientific methods development, providing tools for documentation, presentation and distributed computing.

People are sending text constantly online via social media, chat rooms and blogs. Tapping into this information can help businesses gain an advantage and is increasingly a necessary skill for data analytics. Text mining is a unique data mining problem, dealing with real world data that is often heavy on artefacts, difficult to model and challenging to properly manage. Text mining can be seen as a bit of a dark art that is difficult to learn and gain traction. However some basic strategies can often be applied to get good results quite quickly, and the same basic models appear in many text mining challenges.\r\n\r\nThe scikit-learn project is a library of machine learning algorithms for the scientific python stack (numpy & scipy). It is known for having detailed documentation, a high quality of coding and a growing list of users worldwide. The documentation includes tutorials for learning machine learning as well as the library and is a great place to start for beginners wanting to learn data analytics. There is a strong focus on reusable components and useful algorithms, and the text mining sections of scikit-learn follow the \u201cstandard model\u201d of text mining quite well.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will go through the scikit-learn project for machine learning and show how to use it for text mining applications.
