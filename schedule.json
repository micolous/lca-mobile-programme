Often notebook users may produce a data analysis within a notebook and decide they wish to share it with a wider audience. While notebooks offer excellent facilities for data visualisation, they are less than ideal as a medium for sharing these visualisations more broadly. Interacting with data in a notebook requires knowledge of programming. Notebooks with static data displays are more accessible to non-technical audiences, but static displays severely limit the breadth and depth of data that can be explored within one notebook. So the question arises: How can we provide our audience with the ability to explore our data?\r\n\r\nDeveloping interactive data displays for the web typically requires knowledge of web technologies that notebook users may not possess. To bridge this gap, a flurry of recent activity has focussed on the development of tools that facilitate interactivity within notebooks. Such tools include interactive plotting tools that enable actions such as zooming and selecting of data within plots, user interface elements (eg. drop-down menus, sliders) that can be incorporated into notebooks, and tools that facilitate the arrangement of plots and information into dashboard-like displays.\r\n\r\nMy team at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has used these tools to build shareable interactive data displays comparing weather forecasts against observations across Australia. In this talk we will review currently available tools that facilitate interactivity within notebooks, share our experience in using them, and the practices we have developed around their use. A simple step-by-step example will demonstrate how we can put together an interactive data display allowing selective plotting of data through UI controls and interaction with the plots.", "Title": "Using Jupyter notebooks to develop and share interactive data displays", "URL": "https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/143/view_talk", "Event": 51, "Start": "2016-08-12 15:00:00", "Presenter_emails": "i.ioannou@bom.gov.au", "Presenters": "Ioanna Ioannou", "Duration": "0:40:00", "Id": 55, "video_release": "True", "Room Name": "Room 106"}, {"Description": "Django's new Channels feature takes Django beyond the world of HTTP's request-response protocol and into the modern Web protocol world of WebSockets and real-time communication - but it also does a lot more.

Whenever you see a URL starting with https:// (https:), your browser is sending the HTTP (or Spdy) traffic through a Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel. Part of establishing this secure tunnel involves your browser validating an X.509 certificate provided by the website you're viewing. This allows you to be sure that the server on the other end is who it says it is before you send some potentially sensitive information like your username and password.\r\n\r\nThis is just one example of how these technologies can be used, but there are many more. In distributed systems that communicate sensitive information, like user data, it is imperative to have a mutual authentication mechanism, where the client is confident it is talking to the right service, as well as the service being confident it is talking to the right client. Beyond strong authentication, it is usually desirable to have some authorization logic, to prevent clients from having unrestricted access to all services. \r\n\r\nSince any TCP communication can be tunneled through TLS, and TLS supports such mutual authentication through X.509 certificates, they are the perfect set of tools for the job. The problem to solve then becomes how you manage all of these certificates.\r\n\r\nCrafting simple certificates with the openssl command line is a bit tricky but doable. However, modern certificates support a variety of advanced features and it is quite complicated to take full advantage of them through the command line, especially in a programmatic way. This is where Python can be a powerful tool. Through the use of certain libraries, you can inject valuable information into your certificates that can be used for many purposes, such as establishing a robust authorization model for a service.\r\n\r\nIn this session we'll explore some of the ways you can leverage X.509 certificate features to better protect your systems and data. We'll give specific examples of how to use Python for the programmatic management of complex certificates as well as talking about how the largest website on the Internet, Facebook, handles hundreds of thousands of such certificates in its internal infrastructure, using these same approaches.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you will understand how to craft your own elaborate certificates with Python and how to use them to secure communications between networked services.", "Title": "Empowering X.509 Certificate Management with Python", "URL": "https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/68/view_talk", "Event": 80, "Start": "2016-08-14 13:40:00", "Presenter_emails": "mfdutra@gmail.com", "Presenters": "Marlon Dutra", "Duration": "0:40:00", "Id": 108, "video_release": "True", "Room Name": "Room 103"}, {"Description": "With tens of millions of Python invocations every day, what\u2019s a packager to do?  The answer selected must account for the insanity of a deeply-heterogeneous production environment: different kernels, different OS distributions, even different versions of system Python.  It also needs enough context to carry with it a consistent reference point for when it was packaged relative to the work of thousands of engineers in a single, unified source control tree.  Lastly, at Facebook scale with hundreds of thousands of servers, every byte sent over the network and stored on disk counts, and every CPU cycle wasted can create a myriad of challenges associated with data center operations management.\r\n \r\nSure, it\u2019d be easy to show what a beautiful, easy packaging format we\u2019ve developed at Facebook, and sing its praises, but that\u2019s not what this talk is about.

Worse still, the human costs can be difficult to justify: It\u2019s difficult to get volunteers to do more unpaid work than they\u2019re already doing. If your community depends on Open Source software, you get the added political difficulty of needing to navigate the divide between large-scale change and making small improvements to systems your community actively contributes to.\r\nWhilst the motivation might be different, the process isn\u2019t: leading a community towards change means understanding why existing systems aren\u2019t suitable, making your community enthusiastic about the need for change, and then actually making that change.\r\nTo help make this point more concretely, we\u2019ll look at how and why linux.conf.au \u2013 a long-running Open Source conference in Australia \u2013 effected a move away away from a bespoke legacy conference management software to one based on Symposion, the popular Django-based software created for the Python Software Foundation.

Come along and see what high school students are capable of, and how we can help them get there!", "Title": "A Project-Driven Approach to Teaching Python: A Showcase of Student Work and Achievements", "URL": "https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/124/view_talk", "Event": 60, "Start": "2016-08-14 13:40:00", "Presenter_emails": "bruce@fuda.me", "Presenters": "Bruce Fuda", "Duration": "0:40:00", "Id": 132, "video_release": "True", "Room Name": "Room 106"}, {"Description": "Psychology is a diverse discipline that involves the scientific study of behaviour and cognition. As part of undergraduate training in psychology, students are required to develop substantial skills in research methods and critical thinking. Here, I will discuss our recent efforts to use computer programming to aid in the student achievement of such outcomes. We have introduced a programming component in two third-year undergraduate psychology courses. As part of 'Vision & Brain', students learn to use Python (particularly the package 'PsychoPy') to implement their own vision science experiments. As part of 'Research Internship', students learn to use Python (particularly the 'numpy' and 'veusz' packages) to perform data analyses and to produce visualisations. The aim of these new course components is to provide students with a set of skills that will increase their ability to conduct research, but also to increase their problem solving and critical thinking skills through the process of coding. I will discuss our educational and practical implementation of such material and will use the results of student surveys and feedback to evaluate their effectiveness. Finally, I will discuss some of the challenges we encountered and give some indications of potential future developments.", "Title": "Teaching programming in undergraduate psychology", "URL": "https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/79/view_talk", "Event": 83, "Start": "2016-08-14 14:20:00", "Presenter_emails": "ddamienn@gmail.com", "Presenters": "Damien Mannion", "Duration": "0:40:00", "Id": 133, "video_release": "True", "Room Name": "Room 106"}, {"Description": "This talk will explore the various mental health pressures and impacts that development can have, as well as the strategies developers, and their workplaces, can use to deal with them to support those who may be suffering.\r\nMany conversations have been started about mental health in technology, and it is important for these to continue. Parts of the development process can sometimes lead to situations where looking after yourself can be difficult and it is important not only to be able to minimise the risk of these, but to be able to recognise them and find ways out of them. \r\nOn the other hand, the amount of technology to help combat mental health is increasing, and what better demographic to test, use and further develop these technologies than developers themselves.
